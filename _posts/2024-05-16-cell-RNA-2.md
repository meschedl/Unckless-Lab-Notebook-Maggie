title: Second Set of RNA Extracts from Cells
---

## Extracting RNA from Dinn-1 infected with DiNV for RNASeq 2 

Cells had been infected [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/04/26/infect-cells-RNA.html) and either flash frozen at day 0 (no infection), day 1, day 3, or day 5. The first set went well so I went ahead and did the rest of them. I also included 80ul of the P4 virus stock as a sample, this was to check that there was no RNA from any other virus in our stocks. 

Process was very similar to the fly extracts, except no homogenization with a pestle. 

Samples extracted:

**Extraction**

- Placed centrifuge at 4C
- Got dry ice from BioStore 
- Prepared fresh 100% isopropanol and 75% ethanol
- Wiped down all surfaced and equipment with RNase Away, working in the fume hood, had set up both solid and liquid waste disposal containers
- Placed sample tubes on dry ice 
- Added 500ul cold trizol reagent to each tube
- Pipette mixed samples to homogenize
- Incubated samples at room temp for 5 min
- Added 100ul of cold chloroform to each tube
- Inverted tubes by hand rapidly for 15 seconds 
- Incubated tubes for 3 minutes at room temp 
- Centrifuged tubes for 15 min at 12,000g at 4C 
- There was phase separation in the tubes 
- Removed the aqueous (top) phase to new tubes
    - about 290ul for each tube 
- Discarded organic phase in liquid waste then tube in solid waste 
- Added 1ul of glycogen to each tube 
- Added 250ul of 100% isopropanol to each tube 
    - This is supposed to be .5mL of isopropanol to every 1mL of trizol used, so because I used .5mL trizol, I used .25mL isopropanol 
- Inverted tubes to mix 
- Incubated tubes at room temp for 10 minutes
- Centrifuged tubes for 10 minutes at 4C 12,000g
- There was a visible pellet in each tube 
- Removed the supernatant to hazardous waste
- Washed the pellet with 1mL 75% ethanol 
    - Inverted sample 2x
    - Centrifuged 7,500g for 5 min at 4C 
- Air dried the pellet for 5 minutes (don't ovr dry!)
- Resuspended pellet in 30ul of nuclease free water from the DNase kit 
- Incubated tubes in heat block at 55C for 10 minutes
- Moved directly to DNA removal 

**Invitrogen™ DNA-free™ DNA Removal Kit**

- Need to remove any contaminating DNA 
- Thawed reagents on ice, vortexed and spun down (not inactivation reagent) 
- Added 2.5ul 10X DNase I buffer to each tube 
- Added 1ul rDNase I to each tube 
- Pipette mixed 
- Incubated tubes on heat block at 37C for 20 min 
- Resuspended DNase inactivation reagent by flicking 
- Added 2.5ul DNase inactivation reagent to each tube
- Pipette mixed 
- Incubated tubes for 2 min at room temp on orbital shaker 
- Centrifuged tubes at 10,000g for 1.5 min at room temp 
- Transferred the supernatant to new 1.5mL tubes 
- Placed tubes on ice 
- Immediately quantified samples, then afterwards froze them at -80 

Qubit 

Followed [general qubit protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCz0SBof6LHE3P_LbftawFyexl8iCECUlvjIcauPYwY/edit?tab=t.0), used HS RNA kit

Samples 10, 44, 30 and P4 were run on an RNA tapestation, see results [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ZavwBYtP_RfgO0Vil3MfK6D6Es81jLVH)
