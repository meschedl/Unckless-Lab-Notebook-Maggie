## Second Attempt at pAc5 GFP Plasmid Transfection with DinnDiNV 3.1 and S2 Cells 

The previous attempt at a transfection with the DinnDiNV cells showed inconclusive results, there may have been some GFP expression but it was very hard to tell. I thought that maybe the 20% FBS medium could have interfierred with the transfection reagent, I had only ever used it with 10% FBS before. So I am re-doing the experiment with [3.1 cells plated](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/05/23/Cell-work-5-23.html) in 10% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium. Those cells settled on the plate for about 3 days until transfection. The day before transfection, I also [plated S2 cells](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/05/25/Plating-S2-plate-9.html) for control at about 150,000 cells per mL.

The pAc5 plasmid was concentrated to 1ug/ul in the [previous transfection](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/05/10/DinnDiNV-pAc5-transfection.html), and I used an aliquot from that. 

**Transfection**
- All processes were done in the cell culture hood
- The plasmid DNA and transfection reagent were thawed, vortexed, spun down, and kept at room temp
- Made 2 master mix tubes with the transfection reagents:
- Tube 1 - controls
    - 300ul Schneider’s medium
- Tube 2 - 1ul reagent per well
    - 600ul Schneider’s medium
    - 6ul concentrated pAc5 plasmid
    - 6ul 2020 reagent
- All tubes were pipette mixed gently
- Tubes were left in the cell culture hood for 30 minutes so the liposome complexes could form
- Then, the reagent mix was added dropwise to the appropriate well:
    - Tube 1: 100ul into wells A1, A2, and A3
    - Tube 2: 102ul into wells B1, C1, B2, C2, B3, and C3
        - Note that C3 had a lot less fluid added to it, I was short on reagent. It may have been that I added 106ul instead of 102ul 
- The plate was gently rocked back and forth a few times to try to mix the reagent around in the wells
- Then the plate was placed in the 23C incubator and will be checked every 24 hours

Every ~24 hours images will be taken with the GFP filter and can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QST7qnSfboM4vAOnQXnmI9Vb-FIFg2l9E35pMxfGk3E/edit#slide=id.g225acff9596_0_123) and in bulk [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-bNT3CrQu6yiIE17eUtj01HIFo2oq8lo)
