title: Plating Myd88 and Dv-1 Cells for Another DiNV Infection Test
---

## Counting and Plating Myd88 and Dv-1 Cells to Infect Them With DiNV

The plan is to do full replication this time, 3 replicates for every treatment/condition, for both day 0 and day 5. I will do this in 12 well plates, so  I will need only 2 plates. 
I want to seed cells at 100,000 cells per Myd88 well and 75,000 cells per Dv-1 well. This is more than I did previously but that should be fine hopefully. 

Plate layouts:

| Day 0 | 1                                   |   | 2                                    |   | 3                             |   | 4                              |   |

Because there will be 12 wells for each cell type, and 1.5mL in each well, I will need ~18mL of properly diluted cells to separate out. 

**Dv-1 cells**
- Tapped off cells from P30 flask and removed the liquid 
- Centrifuged the tube for 3 min at 400rpm 
- Removed the supernatant 
- Resuspended the cell pellet in 5mL 10% FBS Schneider's medium 
- 20ul from the resuspention was added to a hemocytometer and counts from each section of the hemocytometer were taken:

|section|quadrant 1|quadrant 2| quadrant 3| quadrant 4|section average|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|176|172|168|186|175|
|2|185|202|177|165|182|

- Each section was averaged, and the average of the two sections was taken
  - Total DV-1 average: 178.5
- The cells per mL is the average * 10^4
  - 178.5 * 10^4 = 1,785,000 cells per mL 
- (1.785*10^6 cells/mL)(5mL) = (75,000 cell/mL)(xmL)
    - x = 119mL medium
- Because I only want 18mL, I divided the xmL and the cell volume 5mL by 5
    - 23.8mL 10% FBS medium 
    - 1mL cell resuspention 
- This was made, and 1.5mL Dv-1 cell suspension was put in wells A1, B1, C1, A3, B3, and C3 in both plates

**Myd88 cells**
- Scraped cells from P20 flask and removed the liquid 
- Centrifuged the tube for 3 min at 400rpm 
- Removed the supernatant 
- Resuspended the cell pellet in 3mL 10% FBS Schneider's medium 
- 20ul from the resuspention was added to a hemocytometer and counts from each section of the hemocytometer were taken:

|section|quadrant 1|quadrant 2| quadrant 3| quadrant 4|section average|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|212|215|196|256|219|
|2|201|204|170|191|191|

- Each section was averaged, and the average of the two sections was taken
  - Total Myd88 average: 205
- The cells per mL is the average * 10^4
  - 205 * 10^4 = 2,050,000 cells per mL 
- (2.05*10^6 cells/mL)(3mL) = (100,000 cell/mL)(xmL)
    - x = 61.5mL medium
- Because I only want 18mL, I divided the xmL and the cell volume 5mL by 3
    - 205mL 10% FBS medium 
    - 1mL cell resuspention 
- This was made, and 1.5mL Dv-1 cell suspension was put in wells A2, B2, C2, A4, B4, and C4 in both plates
- Both plates were put in the incubator to wait for 2 days
