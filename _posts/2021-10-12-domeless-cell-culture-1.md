Title: Domeless Flies Day 1 Cage Setup, Filtering, and Cell Culture Prep
---

## Cage set up for Domeless fly egg laying, then egg collection and cell culture preparation the day after. Trying using trypsin to break up cell clumps.

### 2021 10 11 Yeast Pate on Apple Juice Plates
- Paced two streaks of yeast on two apple juice plates, covered, and let sit overnight
  - Yeast is the same made last week


### 2021 10 12 Breeding Cage Setup
- Using two vials from 9/20 that are very full of flies (other times, 3 vials are needed)
- Washed the cage with tap water, paper towel, distilled water, then paper towel again
- Took plate and cage to fly room
- Plugged in CO2 and turned on valve
- Rotated and pulled out the cotton plug on the first vial
- Tipped the vial over onto the CO2 plate
- Kept tapping until ~all the flies had come down, moved the vial around the CO2 plate to not squish the flies
- Used a paint brush to move the files to a corner
- Repeated process with the second vial
- Plugged and tossed the old vials in the fly trash
- Put the yeast plate on the red section of the cage
- Brushed the flies gently into the clear cage
- Put sideways and put the red cap on the cage
- Rotated the cage slowly on it's side on the bench for ~5 minutes so the flies could wake up
- Set the cage upright on the bench for overnight
- Turned off and unplugged the CO2

### 2021 10 13 Domeless Egg Collection and Cell Culture Prep
- Made 50% wash solution
  - 10mL bleach
  - 10mL 1X wash
- Turned on UV and blower in the TC hood for 15 minutes
- Took out 0.25% trypsin and medium from the fridge to warm on the bench then into the hood after the UV stopped

**Fly Room**
- Set up CO2
- Tapped fly cage onto the CO2 plate until all flies were asleep
- Took out red cap and plate and covered the plate immediately. Plate had a lot of dead flies and a lot of eggs
- Put in new yeast plate to the red part and re-capped cage. _accidentally pushed my nail into the agar while setting up
- Rotated the cage horizontally until the flies woke up
- Set up the cage for overnight
- Turned off all CO2

**Filtering**
- Made small beaker with 70& ethanol
- Picked off dead flies and put in ethanol
- Set up the filter rig: autoclaved erlenmeyer flask, 100um filter, 400um filter, then the funnel
- Squirted water into the plate and began mixing up the yeast with a paint brush
- Tipped over the plate into the funnel and squirted water to wash the liquid down
- Not all the yeast was gone so I brushed and rinsed two more times
- Took off the funnel and rinsed the green filter with water
- Took of the green filter and rinsed the yellow with 1X wash for close to 2 minutes. There was some black flakes that made it onto the yellow filter, probably fly parts
- Flipped the yellow filter over into a new 50mL conical
- Serologically pipetted 10mL 50% bleach into the filter to wash out the eggs
- Used a pasteur pipette to transfer the 10mL to a siliconized 10mL tube
- Let sit for 3 minutes: lots of eggs settled!
- Centrifuged for 3 minutes at 400rcf

**In Tissue Culture Hood**
- Made sure trypsin was at room temp
- Turned on the vacuum pretty light
- Used siliconized pasteur pipette (SPP) and the vacuum to aspirate off the bleach
- Added 10mL trypsin to the 10mL tube and inverted _the liquid turned purple! The red dye in the trypsin turns purple with basic pH_
- Centrifuged 3 min 400rcf
- Asprirated off the liquid with an SPP
- Added 10mL trypsin and inverted _the liquid was less purple this time_
- Centrifuged 3 min 400rcf
- Asprirated off the liquid with an SPP
- Added 10mL trypsin and inverted _the liquid was pretty close to the usual red_
- Centrifuged 3 min 400rcf
- Asprirated off the liquid with an SPP to about ~200ul
- Added back in 2mL fresh trypsin
- Unwrapped dounce mortar and put in a separate rack
- Used the SPP to pipette mix once and transfer all the liquid from the 10mL tube to the dounce
- Homogenized for ~30 seconds, press down and twist, then release up, about 3 times
- Laid the pestle back down on the clean autoclaved foil
- Let the dounce with the sample sit for 30 min in the hood
  - Every ~10 minutes, took the pestle and put it in the dounce and lifted up (no pressure) once just to mix the liquid
- After the incubation: used an SPP to transfer the liquid from the dounce into a **new** siliconized 10mL glass tube (the old tube had un-homogenized eggs stuck to the sides)
- Added 8mL 420 medium without serum to the 10mL tube and inverted
- Centrifuged **800**rcf for 3 minutes (program 1)
- Aspirated off the liquid with an SPP
- Added 10mL 420 medium without serum and inverted
- Centrifuged **800**rcf for 3 minutes (program 1)
- Aspirated off the liquid with an SPP
- Added 2mL medium **with** serum to the 10mL tube
- Made two new 25cm2 flasks
  - 10263 domeless P1 primary 10/13 MES
- Added 8mL 420 medium with serum to one flask
- Used SPP and bulb to transfer the liquid from the 10mL tube to the flask with the medium
- Used a 5mL serological pipette to pipette mix once, then transfer 5mL to the second flask
- Laid flasks flat and placed in the 23 degree incubator
- Cleaned up:
  - Rinsed: flask, dounce, beaker, and 10mL tubes
  - Add 1 drop of detergent to the 10mL tube and rinse: removes all the stuck eggs!
  - Cleared away pipettes, wiped work station, autoclaved with rinsed items
