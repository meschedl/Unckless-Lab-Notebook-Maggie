title: Inoculating Dinn Cells for Experimental DiNV Evolution
---

## Incoulating 3 Replicate Dinn Cell Flasks for Monitoring DiNV Evolution over 3 Months 

Cells are 3 replicate flasks of Dinn3 cells that were plated [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/09/13/plating-cells-for-experimental-evolution.html) and tested for virus [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/09/14/DNA-extracts-Day-Neg-6.html). Samples wre virus negative. 

Plan for whole experiment is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kpb_gmf4_iT9c170tt_A3VLWrD1SFiDeJmel2aZ7hto/edit)

All processes were done in the cell culture hood and with sterile technique

- A 200ul vial of fly homogenate #5 was thawed on ice and vortexed 
- 2 samples of 50ul of supernatant was taken from each flask for a day 0 sample (see table below)
- For each flask, 2.3mL of supernatant was removed and discarded 
- Then, 5mL of new 10% FBS, 4% mushroom extract Schneider's Medium with antibiotics was added to each flask 
- 50ul of fly homogenate was added to each flask, and after adding each flask was gently rocked back and forth gently for 1 minute 
- The remaining ~50ul in the tube was saved as a fly homogenate sample and frozen along with the other samples 
- All 1.5mL tubes were frozen at -20C 
- Flasks were placed in the back of the 23C incubator and will be left for 3 weeks (and probably checked on once a week)
