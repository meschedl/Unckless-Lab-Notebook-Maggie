## Testing Cell Transfection Reagents and pAc5 GFP Expression Plasmid on Primary innubila Cells with S2 Cells as a Control

- This time I decided to do a more controlled experiment where I used S2 cells as a positive control, and I decided to make the primary cells the day before the transfection so they would be the most alive/most likely to be dividing
- On 10/25 I plated S2 cells in wells A1-A3, and plated fresh primaries in wells B1-3 and C1-3. Primary "supernatant" is in column 4 in the plate, but they were not used for the experiment
- The only controls used were cells without plasmid or reagent
- I tried both a 1:1 ratio of plasmid DNA to reagent, and 2:1 plasmid DNA to reagent. The plasmid DNA is at 1ug/ul, so adding 2ul instead of 1ul doubles the amount of plasmid added
- Because of the plasmid DNA ratio increase, technically there are no replicates for the experimental conditions, the only replicate is the plain primary cells

- All of this was done at room temperature in the cell culture hood. Transfection reagents were thawed at room temp, vortexed, and spun down before use
- Reagent tubes were made for each experimental condition:
  - Tube 1:
    - 300ul Schneider's medium
  - Tube 2:
    - 200ul Schneider's medium
    - 2ul pAc5 plasmid
    - 4ul insect transfection reagent
  - Tube 3:
    - 100ul Schneider's medium
    - 2ul pAc5 plasmid
    - 2ul insect transfection reagent
  - Tube 4:
    - 200ul Schneider's medium
    - 2ul pAc5 plasmid
    - 6ul 2020 reagent
  - Tube 5:
    - 200ul Schneider's medium
    - 2ul pAc5 plasmid
    - 3ul 2020 reagent
- All tubes were pipette mixed and incubated in the hood for 30 minutes
- Then the reagent mixes were dropped into the wells:
  - A1: 100ul tube 1
  - A2: 103ul tube 2
  - A3: 104ul tube 4
  - B1: 100ul tube 1
  - B2: 103ul tube 2
  - B3: 104ul tube 4
  - C1: 100ul tube 1
  - C2: 104ul tube 3
  - C3: 105ul tube 5
- The plate was gently rocked back and forth and put in the 23 degree incubator for 24 hours, then checked. The plate was always kept in the incubator between checks

**20221027 Checking transfections**
- S2 cells with the transfection reagents had a few GFP cells after 24 hours, and the amount grew over the days of checking them
- No innubila experimental wells showed any evidence of GFP after 24 or more hours
- Again there was a lot of autofluorescence in the primary cells so it's very hard to tell if there is GFP or not, but it really looks the same as the controls, and I didn't see any of the neon green indicative of GFP
- I imaged the plates in a much more comprehensive manner this time, and I also included bright field images, seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zw-4ONRBFsSmnhS3S2_1rK8dx0jlIkIR7JeeLPs7Nj0/edit#slide=id.g187f2e11049_0_61)
