## Doing CO1 and p47 PCRs on DNA from [Single Fly DNA Extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/09/29/dna-extracts-48-innubila-dinv-test.html) to Test for DiNV Infection

Samples for PCR:

| tube_number |
|-------------|
| 99          |
| 50          |
| 62          |
| 90          |

| 83          |

PCR followed [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) using the CO1 and p47 primers, and _n_ number of 17, a positive and negative control for each primer set, and cycling conditions indicated [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0)

1 gel was run for both primer sets, 1% gel, 90V, 30 minutes:
