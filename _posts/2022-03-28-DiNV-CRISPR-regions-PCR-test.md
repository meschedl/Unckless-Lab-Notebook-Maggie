Here I got worried because I designed these primers myself, so if they don't work it's truly my fault. But I thought up some ways to try the PCRs again.

**20220330 PCR Again of 77-DiNV-1**
- Here I changed a few things:
  - Lowered the annealing temperature by 2 degrees C to 52 degrees
  - Increased the time for annealing from 30 seconds to 1 min

  - Tested 3 different DNA samples

  - 95 degrees C 2 min

Success! The PCR worked! The product is supposed to be 1,414bp long, and this looks exactly right! Now to try the modified PCR parameters on the other primers

**20220331 77-DiNV-2 PCR Again**
- Here I only used the 2mL sample as the sample because I know it should work
