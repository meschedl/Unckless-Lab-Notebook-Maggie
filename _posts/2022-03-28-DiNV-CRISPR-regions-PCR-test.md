Here I got worried because I designed these primers myself, so if they don't work it's truly my fault. But I thought up some ways to try the PCRs again.

**20220330 PCR Again of 77-DiNV-1**

Success! The PCR worked! The product is supposed to be 1,414bp long, and this looks exactly right! Now to try the modified PCR parameters on the other primers

**20220331 77-DiNV-2 PCR Again**
- Here I only used the 2mL sample as the sample because I know it should work
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 5mL GoTaq * 2.2 = 11ul

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/20220404-gel.jpeg)

There is proper amplification of 77-DiNV-2, but none for either of the 130 regions. There is a small amount of off target amplification for the 77 amplicon, I can hopefully get rid of that by lowering the primer concentration

**20220405 Retry 130 1 and 2**
- I tried both the 2mL sample and the 3mL sample, and lowered the annealing temp to 50 degrees C
- 130-DiNV-1
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 5mL GoTaq * 3.3 = 16.5ul
  - 0.25ul 130-F-1 * 3.3 = 0.825ul
  - 0.25ul 130-R-1 * 3.3 = 0.825ul

  - 12 degrees C hold
  - Italic lines are cycled 34 times
- Tubes were placed in the fridge afterwards
- 130-DiNV-2
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 5mL GoTaq * 3.3 = 16.5ul
  - 0.25ul 130-F-2 * 3.3 = 0.825ul
  - 0.25ul 130-R-2 * 3.3 = 0.825ul
  - 3.5 molec grade water * 3.3 = 11.55ul

Again no proper amplification...

**20220405 Retry 130-DiNV-2 with Gradient**
- I talked to Kistie and she helped me set up a gradient PCR on the machine to try different annealing temperatures
- She also said that, at least for the 130-DiNV-2 primer, it may have too many Cs and hold on too tight to the DNA, and that I should lower my annealing time to 30 seconds
- So I decided to do a gradient from 40 degrees to 50 degrees and put samples at a couple of different annealing temperatures:
  - 40 degrees - tubes A
  - 41.9 degrees - tubes B
  - 43.9 degrees - tubes C
  - 46.2 degrees - tubes D
  - 47.9 degrees - tubes E
  - 49.2 degrees - tubes F
- Each of these temperatures will get a 2mL sample and a negative control
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 5mL GoTaq * 13 = 65ul
  - 0.25ul 130-F-2 * 13 = 3.25ul
  - 0.25ul 130-R-2 * 13 = 3.25ul
  - 3.5 molec grade water * 13 = 45.5ul
- Vortexed and spun down mix, kept on ice
- Assembled PCR strip tubes on ice:
  - Added 9ul master mix to each tube
  - Added 1ul DNA to the sample tubes
  - Added 1ul molec grade water to the negative control tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Placed tubed in the thermocycler:
  - 95 degrees C 2 min
  - 95 degrees C 30 sec
  - _gradient degrees C 30 seconds_
  - _72 degrees C 2 minutes and 30 seconds_
  - _72 degrees C 5 min_
  - 12 degrees C hold
  - Italic lines are cycled 34 times
- Tubes were placed in the fridge afterwards
- Then a 1% gel was run for 35 minutes at 90V:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/20220406-gel.jpeg)

Basically nothing amplified in any of these, except I saw something in the 40 degree sample. It was very faint and didn't show up well in the picture. I want to try more cycles with that temp

**20220407 Retry 130-DiNV-2 with 40 cycles**
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 5mL GoTaq * 2.2 = 11ul
  - 0.25ul 130-F-2 * 2.2 = 0.55ul
  - 0.25ul 130-R-2 * 2.2 = 0.55ul
  - 3.5 molec grade water * 2.2 = 7.7ul
- Vortexed and spun down mix, kept on ice
- Assembled PCR strip tubes on ice:
  - Added 9ul master mix to each tube
  - Added 1ul DNA to the sample tube
  - Added 1ul molec grade water to the negative control tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Placed tubed in the thermocycler:
  - 95 degrees C 2 min
  - 95 degrees C 30 sec
  - _40 degrees 30 seconds_
  - _72 degrees C 2 minutes and 30 seconds_
  - _72 degrees C 5 min_
  - 12 degrees C hold
  - Italic lines are cycled 40 times
- Tubes were placed in the fridge afterwards
- Then a 1% gel was run for 35 minutes at 90V:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/20220407-gel.jpeg)

There is nothing that showed up, honestly I probably got a tiny faint thing show up in the 20220405 gel because it stained for 1.5hours.

At this point I stopped trying to get 130-DiNV-2 to work because it wouldn't amplify in any circumstance. I decided to try the same gradient on 130-DiNV-1.

**20220411 Try 130-DiNV-1 with Gradient**
- Trying the same gradient as above:
  - 40 degrees - tubes A
  - 41.9 degrees - tubes B
  - 43.9 degrees - tubes C
  - 46.2 degrees - tubes D
  - 47.9 degrees - tubes E
  - 49.2 degrees - tubes F
- Each of these temperatures will get a 2mL sample and a negative control
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 5mL GoTaq * 13 = 65ul
  - 0.25ul 130-F-2 * 13 = 3.25ul
  - 0.25ul 130-R-2 * 13 = 3.25ul
  - 3.5 molec grade water * 13 = 45.5ul
- Vortexed and spun down mix, kept on ice
- Assembled PCR strip tubes on ice:
  - Added 9ul master mix to each tube
  - Added 1ul DNA to the sample tubes
  - Added 1ul molec grade water to the negative control tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Placed tubed in the thermocycler:
  - 95 degrees C 2 min
  - 95 degrees C 30 sec
  - _gradient degrees C 30 seconds_
  - _72 degrees C 3 minutes_
  - _72 degrees C 5 min_
  - 12 degrees C hold
  - Italic lines are cycled 34 times
- Tubes were placed in the fridge afterwards
- Then a 1% gel was run for 35 minutes at 90V:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/202200411-gel.jpeg)

Well here I got some things to amplify but they are all off target. The product is supposed to be ~3,000bp long. I might have to try making primers for this region again and making them amplify a smaller region.
