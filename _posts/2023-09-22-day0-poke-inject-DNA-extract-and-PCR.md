title: DNA extractions and PCRs on day0 poke or inject flies
---

## Single Fly DNA extracts and TPI and p47 PCRs on day0 D. innubila that either got poked or injected with DiNV 

Samples are from [This infection](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/09/08/16Cq-Nanoject-2.html)

Samples were single flies in tubes, and had their DNA extracted with the [DiNV specific DNA extraction protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/single_fly_DNA_extraction_DiNV.md) that takes care to minimize contamination and includes two extraction controls in each round of extraction. Information on the order of samples and their extraction dates can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L2lz6xhP6HPd_r8I1Q9lFVBZtPBmidh-QtuUhuZBy4o/edit#gid=0)

After all samples had their DNA extracted, each sample went through PCR for TPI and p47. The [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) was followed, and the primer information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0). The p47 program was for 30 cycles. After, all samples were run a 1% gel for 35 minutes at 90V.
