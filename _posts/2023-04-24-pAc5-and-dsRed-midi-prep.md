## Midiprep Plasmid Extraction of [pAc5-EGFP](https://www.addgene.org/21181/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9ZGYBhCEARIsAEUXITXYqeBl6QqXrJR0GxbEaTQGLUSOCpfQiJ-waw5cYcB-SRt2y2rCbsoaAkoaEALw_wcB) and [pBS-99F8-5’HR-attP>>Act5C::dsRed<](https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/product/View?product=1544)

I needed more pAc5 plasmid and we just purchased the pBS-99F8-5’HR-attP>>Act5C::dsRed< (or 1544 dsRed plasmid as I'll call it). Only the 1544dsRed plasmid is plated from an agar stab. 

**20230418 Plating Agar Stab**
- Warmed 2 LB plates on the bench, each with 100ug/mL Ampicillin (Kistie had made these previously)
- Sterilized the bench space and the loop before use
- Labeled 2 plates with the plasmid information
- Dipped the loop in the 1544dsRed agar stab and spread on an LB plate
- Sterilized the loop between each plate
- Plates were placed upside down in the 37C incubator overnight, then put in the fridge the next day

**20230419 Overnight Culture**
- In the afternoon, the best 1544dsRed plate with visible individual colonies was used to grow overnight cultures
- Labeled 3 LB tubes
- Sterilized the bench space and used the flame
- Diluted Ampicillin:
  - Want 100ug/mL in 2mL
  - (100,000mg/mL)(x) = 100mL * 2mL
    - x = 0.002mL or 2ul
- Added 2ul of Ampicillin stock to each LB tube
- Picked 1 colony from the plate with a pipette tip and dropped it in the test tube
- Placed the tubes in the 37C incubator shaking overnight

**20230420 Making Glycerol Stock for 1544deRed**
- Sterilized the bench space and used the flame
- Made up 2 cryotubes for making stocks
  - 143: pBS-99F8-5’HR-attP>>Act5C::dsRed< 
- Added 750ul of 50% glycerol to each cryotube
- Added 750ul of culture to the tubes and pipette mixed
- Bleached the test tubes when done
- Tubes went into the bacterial stocks and the back up stocks boxes in the -80

**20230423 Making Overnight Cultures from Stock Grown Plates**
- Want to make 150mL of culture for both plasmids
- Made 300mL of LB broth:
  - 6g LB
  - 3000mL DI H20
  - Shake to mix
- Aliquoted 150mL into 2 500mL flasks
- Foiled the flasks and autoclaved them on cycle 3
- Put them in the fridge when done
- Took them out before use to warm up a little
- Calculated Ampicillin needed:
  - (100,000ug/mL)(x) = 100ug/mL * 150mL
    - x = 0.15mL or 150ul
- Added 150ul of Ampicillin stock to the liquid LB and swirled it around
- Picked 1 colony from the pAc5 plate and dropped it into the first flask
- Picked 1 colony from the 1544dsRed plate and dropped it into the second flask
- Placed the flasks in the 37 degree shaking incubator overnight

**20230424 Midiprep Extractions**
- Started at 9am
- Took flasks out of the incubator and used serological pipettes to transfer the liquid cultures into 50mL conicals
- Took these tubes to the Egan lab and fast cooled their centrifuge. Then ran it at 6,000rcf at 4C for 20 minutes
- While the centrifuge was running:
  - Got an ice bucket and chilled buffer P3
  - Prepared buffer P1: 
    - 4mL per conical, so 24mL buffer P1
    - 8ul 100mg/mL RNaseA, so 48ul
        - but, there was only 10ul left of that RNase A, so I also added 60ul of 10mg/mL RNase A (that's not enough but hopefully it worked a little bit)
- Got tubes from the Egan lab and poured off the supernatant
  - There was a large bacterial pellet in all tubes
- Added 4mL of buffer P1 and vortexed until the cell pellet was resuspended
- Added 4mL of buffer P2 to each tube
  - Tubes should be gently mixed until all liquid becomes blue and viscous
- Incubated tubes at room temp on the bench for 5 minutes
- Added 4mL cold buffer P3 to each tube
  - Inverted tubes to mix until the liquid was white and not viscous
- Incubated tubes on ice for 15 minutes
- Took tubes to the Egan lab an centrifuged 4C at 12,400rcf for 40 minutes
- Brought up new 15mL tubes to the Egan lab
- By the centrifuge, transferred the supernatant to the new 50mL tubes
- Centrifuged the 50mL tubes for 40 min at 4C 12,400rcf
- Put the small centrifuge in the fridge to cool down
- Turned on the incubator to 65C and warmed buffer QF
- Prepared a new conical of 100% isopropanol and 70% ethanol
- Set up 2 genomic tips over a 50mL conical for waste liquid
- Added 4mL buffer QBT to the tips and let drip through
- Brought tubes downstairs from Egan lab (turned off their centrifuge)
- Transferred supernatant to the tips (one tip per plasmid) and let drip through, repeating for each tube, all liquid going into the same tip for each plasmid. I let the liquid completely drip out before adding in more
- Transferred waste conicals when needed
- Added 10mL of buffer QC to the tips and let drip through
- Added another 10mL buffer QC and let drip through
- Transferred the tips to a new 15mL tube
- Added 5mL of warm buffer QF to the tips and let drip through
- Prepared 7 1.5mL tubes and labeled as final tubes for each plasmid
- Took the eluted liquid from the 15mL conical and spread it out over the 7 1.5mL tubes
  - For the first 6 tubes they would get 833ul elutent each
  - The 7th tube got a different amount of liquid (whatever was left):
    - pAc5: 315ul
    - dsRed: 370ul
- Added 0.7 volumes 100% isopropanol to each of the 1.5mL tubes
  - For 833ul volume tubes, that is 583ul isopropanol
  - For the 7th tube that is:
    - pAc5: 220.5ul
    - dsRed: 259ul
- Inverted tubes to mix
- Centrifuged tubes for 45 minutes at 4C in the small centrifuge, 13,000rcf
  - Afterwards, I was able to see pellets!
- Decanted off supernatant in the 1.5mL tubes
- Added 500ul of cold 70% ethanol to each tube
- Centrifuged tubes 30 minutes at 4C 13,000rcf
- Poured off ethanol and let tubes dry ~2 hrs on the bench
- Resuspended pellets in each tube with 100ul 10mM Tris HCl
- Let tubes incubate on the bench overnight
