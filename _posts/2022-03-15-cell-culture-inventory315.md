## Cell Culture Inventory on 20220315 of _Melanogaster_ Cells


Domeless 03/09  
Top
- 1 flask
- 10% FBS
- Some cells and clumps that look a live, but not a lot of evidence of growth

Bottom
- 2 flasks
- 10% FBS
- Looks similar to the top flask, maybe a few more clumps of cells that look alive. Some places look like there are cells growing out, which is a good sign
- Also there are these small things/dots/debris that look different than anything I've seen before. Maybe contamination, but it's been a week since this was made
- 3mL fluid exchanged on 3/16

SPZ 03/02  
- 1 flask
- Not very many alive cells, if any and no growth evident. This flask was tossed

SPZ 03/03  
Top  
- 1 flask
- 10% FBS
- A lot of debris, some cells that look alive but not a lot. With the debris, probably not going to grow much?
- 3mL fluid exchange 3/16

Bottom  
- 1 flask
- 10% FBS
- Could be less debris than the top flask, more cell clumps, and some evidence of growth/cell division. There was a clump contracting still

Myd88 03/02 fluid from 02/03  
- 3 flasks
- 20% FBS
- A lot of big dark cells that aren't attached, some small thin cells that also look to be growing. These may be promising?

Myd88 02/02  
- 2 flasks
- 20% FBS
- Huge amount of debris in these flasks, no cells growing. Tossed these flasks

Myd88 02/03  
- 3 flasks
- 20% FBS
- Fluid changed at 3rd time on 03/16
- Still looking really good, cells are still alive and in big grow-out groups. Hard to tell how much more growth than the last time I checked, but they still look happy

33098 dicer2 02/10 and 2/11
- 2 flasks
- No growth from any present cells, lots of debris. Tossed these flasks

IMD null 02/23  
- 2 flasks
- 10% FBS
- Cells are still alive looking, but there is a lot of debris. Not that much evidence of growth, but going to keep them anyways
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/20220223-imd-cc-imaged-20220315.jpeg)

IMD null 02/25. 01/26 and 01/27
- 5 flasks including one that had fluid transferred form it
- All had significant amounts of debris and very little cells, if any. All flasks were thrown out

Domeless 02/16
- 2 flasks
- No growth of cells, considerable debris build up, flasks were thrown out
