title: Myd88 and Dv-1 Supernatant and Cell DNA Extractions from Feb 8th Infection
---

## Extracting DNA from Cell and Supernatant Fluid from [Myd88 and Dv-1 DiNV Test Infections](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/02/08/infecting-Myd88-Dv1-cells-20230208.html)

On the 13th, the day 5 samples were taken: supernatant was frozen at -80 in 1.5mL tubes and 1mL of 1X PBS was added to each well of the plate and the plate was frozen at -80C as well. 
I followed the same basic protocol as the [last cell/supernatant extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/01/24/Dv-1-Myd88-Cell-and-Supernant-DNA-Extract.html) I did, except I halved all of the volumes.

**DNA Extraction**

- All samples were thawed on ice
- Lysis solution was chilled on ice until opaque 
- When the plates were thawed, I pipetted the liquid into labeled tubes (see spreadsheet above)
- The cell tubes were then spun down for 5 minutes at 1,500g in the centrifuge to try to pellet the cells (I thought the volume of PBS was too much)
- Then I removed 600ul of liquid from each of the cell tubes, leaving about 300ul (to hopefully concentrate it)
- Made a new 1.5mL tube for each of the 48 samples 
- Mixed all samples before pipetting 
- Added 50ul of supernatant sample to their designated tubes (1-12 and 25-36)
- Added 1ul of 1000:1 diluted lambda DNA to each supernatant extraction tube 
- Added 50ul of cell sample to their designated tubes (13-24 and 37-48)
- Using the Qiagen Puregene Blood and Tissue reagents/method
- Turned on the heat blocks to 65C and 37C and chilled the cell lysis solution on ice until cloudy
- Added 250ul of chilled cell lysis solution to each tube and pipette mixed 10X
- Incubated tubes in the heat block at 65C for 10 minutes
- Diluted RNase A 1:100, 2ul in 198ul of nuclease free water
- Let tubes come to room temp after the heat block
- Added 3ul of RNase A to each tube
- Flipped the tubes 25X to mix them
- Incubated tubes at 37C for 30 minutes in the heat block
- Let tubes come to room temp after incubation
- Added 100ul of protein precipitation solution to each tube
- Vortexed tubes ~10 sec
- Placed tubes on ice for 5 min
- Centrifuged tubes 16,300g for 3 minutes (had to be done in 2 batches)
- Made new tubes with 300ul of fresh 100% ethanol with final tube labels
- Transferred the supernatant from the centrifugation (~400ul) to the new tubes with the isopropanol
- Inverted the tubes 50X
- Centrifuged the tubes 16,300g for 5 minutes (2 batches)
- Discarded the supernatant
    - Note that I didnâ€™t see a pellet in any of the samples
- Added 300ul of fresh 70% ethanol to each tube
- Inverted 3X
- Centrifuged tubes 16,300g 5 min (2 batches)
- Discarded supernatant
- Let tubes air dry upside down on a kim wipe for ~1 hour
- Resuspended DNA in 20ul of DNA hydration solution and let tubes sit overnight
- Tubes were put in the -20 the next day
