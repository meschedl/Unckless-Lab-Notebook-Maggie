title: Replicate 2 of DNA Extractions on D. innubila with High Dilutions of DiNV and PCRs
---

## Set 1 and 2 of DNA Extracts of Male D. innubila From [DiNV Infections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14z52bWO3OVq97uOBtqyV3BqQNTjoNB85Sta_ir17JCQ/edit?gid=2058654582#gid=2058654582) from 02/21 and PCRs

All samples were thawed on ice, [this general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/cell-DNA-extraction-protocol.md) was used, and filter tips were used at all times. I did two sets of extractions, one set of 48 then the remaining 24.

Set of 48:

**20240311 PCRs**

- PCRs were run on the samples, and the process followed the [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) completely.
- Primer information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit?usp=drive_link)
- PCRs were then run on 1% gels for 35 minutes at 90V
