title: Injecting Flies with DiNV for Kent and Gut Dissection 3
---

## Injecting Male and Female D. innubila with DiNV for Kent and Gut Dissection 3

This time both Kent and Rob wanted flies, some for sectioning and some for gut dissection

- Flies had emerged and were separated out the day before, should be 5-7 days old
- All flies got undiluted P4 DiNV 
- 14 new vials of food were made
- Used virus aliquot 37
- Infection followed exactly the [nanoinjection protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/Nanoject-Dinnubila-DiNV-Infection-Protocol.md)
- Fly mortality was not monitored because they were taken for timepoint dissections
