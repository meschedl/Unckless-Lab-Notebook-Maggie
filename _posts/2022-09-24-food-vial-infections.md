## Testing 4 Food Vial Types on Control Poked D. innubila and Monitoring Survival

Testing different food vials to see how long control poked flies live on them. Poked flies on sugar agar don't make it 2 weeks, which seems like not long enough. I am testing sugar agar, sugar agar with mushroom broth (autoclaved), molasses food, and regular instant food with mushroom and cotton roll. I decided to test both males and females just in case we start doing females for infections.

I separated out 15 vials of flies on the 23rd with ~12 males and ~12 females in each. I expect a few to die potentially, so that there are hopefully 10 of each by the next day. This will leave me with 150 flies of each sex!

I used sterile cell culture medium as my control because it will be the control for all the further DiNV infection experiments.

I planned my test to have 3 vials of 10 flies per food type, and a few vials that have flies who weren't poked. 30 males or females in 3 vials of each food type, and then 10 males or females on either sugar agar, mushroom sugar agar, or molasses food. I did not do mushroom instant food for the unpoked flies. I didn't have enough flies and I assume that they live the best on their normal food.

I mixed up the order of the vials randomly so that no one food group of the beginning or the end of the infection period. I also switched the order of poking, so that neither males or females were always poked first or second on the CO2.

I would label two vials, then put the fly vial on the CO2 and record the time. Then I would separate out the sexes, and poke 10 of each, and place them in the appropriate test vials.
