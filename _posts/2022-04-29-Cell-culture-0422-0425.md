## Cell Culture Care and Primary Cell Culture Generation for Weeks of 20220418 and 20220425

**20220422**
- Fluid changed (3mL medium removed, 3mL new 20% FBS Schneider's medium added):
  - 04/04 innubila (1 flask)
  - 04/05 innubila (2 flasks)
  - Secondary flasks from 03/30 Myd88 (6 flasks)
  - 03/09 domeless (1 flask)
- Made 1 secondary flask from the 03/03 SPZ flask
  - Scrapped off flask surface
  - Pipetted liquid out of flask into 10mL tube
  - Centrifuged tube 5 minutes 200rpm
  - Aspirated off top liquid
  - Resuspended the pellet in 5mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium
  - Transferred liquid to a new culture flask
- Made 4 secondary flasks from the remaining 02/03 Myd88 primary flask. Followed the same steps as above, just mixed pellet with 20mL medium and split into 4 new flasks

**20220425**
- Made primary cells from innubila following the [updated protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/03/31/updated-cell-culture-protocol.html)
  - Instead of separating out the homogenate, I centrifuged the homogenate for 2 minutes at 200rpm and removed the supernatant. Then resuspended the pellet in 5mL medium and separated into 2 flasks
- Made 2 flasks of primary cells from 32064 dicer 2 flies, following the same as above
- Made 3 secondary flasks each from 1 flask of 02/24 and 1 flask of 02/25 innubila primary cells. Followed the above steps from 20220422

**20220426**
- Made 3 primary cell flasks from innubila the [updated protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/03/31/updated-cell-culture-protocol.html)
- Made 3 flasks of primary cells from 32064 dicer 2 flies, following the same as above
