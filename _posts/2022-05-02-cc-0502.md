title: Primary Cell Culture and Inventory 20220502
---

## Cell Culture Inventory and Primary Cell Culture Generation Week of 20220502

**20220502**
- Made primary cell culture flasks (2) from 10263 domeless flies using a modified [cell culture protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/03/31/updated-cell-culture-protocol.html), where instead of separating out the homogenate, the whole homogenate was centrifuges at 200rpm for 1 minute, and the pellet was resuspended and separated out into the 2 flasks
- Made primary _D. innubila_ cells in the same way as above
- Did a 3mL fluid change on 1 flask from 01/13 innubula primaries, 2 flasks from 04/04 innubila secondaries, 1 flask from 02/24 innubila primary, and 1 flask from 02/25 innubila primary

**Inventory**

Innubila


Cell scrapped flask from 02/24 and 02/25 (2)
- These flasks were scrapped and made into secondaries
- There are some cells still alive in these, but there is some debris that looks scrapped around too

04/04 secondaries from 01/27 flask (2)
- Some clumps look like they might be expanding but the growth is slow

04/25 primaries (2)
- Found one clump of cells that is contracting
- Lots of floating debris though

4/26 primaries (3)
- Some spots look like there are cells that are alive, not a lot of growth yet

04/25 secondaries from 02/25 (3)
- Lots of floating clumps of cells that won't attach
- There are some attached clumps that are starting to spread out

04/25 secondaries from 02/24 (3)
- Same as the 02/25 secondaries

04/04 primary (1)
- Some evidence of alive cells and maybe growth, but not much

04/05 primaries (2)
- Top flask was full of debris -> thrown out
- Bottom flask has debris too but some evidence of alive cells too so this one was kept

Melanogaster

32064 Dicer2

04/25 primaries (3)
- Lots of clumps of cells
- Mostly they still look alive

04/26 primaries (3)
- Clumps of cells that are alive
- Not really growing out yet

Domeless

03/09 primaries (1)
- There is a clump still contracting in the flask
- Very slow/low growth compared to other good looking flasks but the cells do still look alive

03/30 primaries
- Cells didn't look alive, threw out the flask

IMD null

03/23 primaries (2)
- Both top and bottom were thrownout
- Either full of debris or cells seem dead

04/11 primaries (1)
- Lots of clumps of floating dead cells
- Nothing really alive, flask was thrown out

04/12 primaries (2)
- Same as the 04/11 flask

SPZ

04/22 secondaries from 03/03 (2)
- Some growth
- Lots of clumps that are floating and not attached
- Cells seem alive
