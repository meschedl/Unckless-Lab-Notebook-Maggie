## Doing qPCR to Compare DiNV Levels in Hirt Extracted DNA and Puregene Extracted DNA

Using DNA samples from [Hirt Extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/09/01/hirt-extraction-test-3.html) and [Puregene Extraction](). These DNA are from the exact same samples, just with different extraction methods. The goal is to see if the Hirt method does give a better ratio of DiNV DNA to Dv-1 cell DNA. Samples were normalized to 1ng/ul before use in qPCR. DiNV primers are called 115, and Dv-1 cell primers are RPL11.

**DNA dilution to 1ng/ul**
- All samples were kept on ice and/or thawed on ice

|Tube number|Sample|Sample DNA concentration|ul DNA|ul Molec grade water for 1ng/ul concentration|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Hirt 1.5-2|63.7ng/ul|2ul|127.4ul|
|2|Hirt 0.75|35.5ng/ul|2ul|71ul|
|3|Hirt 0.5-C|130ng/ul|2ul|260ul|
|4|Puregene 1.5-2|3.72ng/ul|3ul|11.16ul|
|5|Puregene 0.75| 3.57ng/ul|3ul|10.71ul|
|6|Puregene 0.5-C|26.1ng/ul|2ul|52.2ul|

**qPCR setup**
- I have 6 samples, which need to be run in triplicate for 2 primers, so that will be 6 * 3 * 2 = 36 separate reactions
- However I will need to make 2 separate mastermixes for the two primers
- Kent suggested starting the machine and the computer before starting the process to make sure no one takes the computer before you need it
  - Turn on qPCR machine so it can warm up
  - Log into computer
  - Click on the Biorad CFX manager
  - Click user defined, then select existing, then KMM, then p47 program
- Using [SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix](https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/product/ssoadvanced-universal-sybr-green-supermix?ID=MH5H1EE8Z) as the reagent for the qPCR 
- Make master mixes on ice
