## Testing Half Instant Food With or Without Mushrooms for innubila Infections

I wanted to test how innubila flies would fair after infection with only ~half the volume of instant food (to save food) and with or without the mushroom. Half food vials consisted of a small scoop of instant food (I think this is a teaspoon) and 5mL of water (compared to a heaping scoop of the large scoop and 10mL of water regular). All food vials had cotton rolls. Half the food vials got a mushroom piece. Half of the flies were poked with sterile cell culture medium, and half were not poked but put on CO2 for at least 5 minutes. See the table below for specificities of the experiment. See the image below for examples of the level of food in each treatment:

Infections followed [this general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/bacteria_fly_infections.md) however no bacteria was used, just sterile cull culture medium.

Every 3 days the food was changed and flies were put on CO2 to count and transfer. The experiment ran for 2 weeks. Look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1umZiEWQUMnh2ksvqjZiBSEioEppQKIv5aK26iOxYHrY/edit#gid=0) for daily mortality counts.
