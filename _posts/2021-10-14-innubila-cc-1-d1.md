Title: Innubila Cell Culture Prep Day 1 and 2
---

# Trying Cell Culture Primary Cell Generation on _Drosophila innubila_ Flies/Eggs on 2021 10 14 and 2021 10 15

- Procedure for collecting eggs, filtering, washing, and setting up in cell culture was followed exactly as with the [domeless flies](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/12/domeless-cell-culture-1.html)
- I used the fresh 420 medium made [that morning](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/14/domeless-cc-1-d2.html)
- This process was done in the afternoon because I was working on domeless flies in the morning. Usually we have done cell culture preparations in the morning
- Kent had made the plates a few days before: apple juice plates with a full layer of yeast paste on the top. Innubila like to push their eggs deep into the agar, so that brushing with a paint brush does not get them out. the idea is that the files will lay the eggs in the yeast and not get to the agar, making it easy to get to the eggs
- Flies were set up for two days: let to lay on a plate overnight, then switched out to a new plate for the next day. After the second day, the flies were split up into two vials and saved for Rob

**Day 1 Notes**

It looked like we got a lot of eggs from _innubila_

The pellet also looked good

But the culture under the microscope (had settled for a few hours) did not look good. The small dots are not fly cells, and there is a lot of debris. I was not able to find any cells. 20X magnification

**Day 2 Notes**

I tried washing the eggs in the filter this day for longer, considering how much debris was in the set from the day before. That may have helped, there seems to be less debris in these flasks. However there are very few, if any cells or cell clumps. This clump may be cells but may not be (20X magnification)
