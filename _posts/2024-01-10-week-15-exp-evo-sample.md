title: Taking the 15 Week Samples for the DiNV Experimental Evolution and DNA Extractions 
---

## Taking Samples and Fluid Changing Flasks at the 15 Week Mark for Experimental DiNV Evolution in Dinn Cells (~106 days) and Extracting DNA from 1 50ul Sample Per Replicate Flask, and Checking Samples for Virus Presence

**Sampling 20240110**

Cells were inoculated on the 26th of Sept [see post here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/09/26/experimental-evolution-inoculation.html). There are 3 replicate flasks that have been left to grow and get infected in the 23C incubator for 106 days. I am only removing supernatant for samples, the cells are not getting passed throughout this experiment, the only thing that happens is a tri-weekly fluid change (once every three weeks). In the [six week sampling](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/11/07/week-6-exp-evo-sampling.html) I took 7 50ul supernatant and 1 1mL supernatant sample per replicate flask.  

All steps took place in the cell culture hood 

- Using 10% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium with antibiotics in the hood to room temperature 
- Prepared 1.5mL tubes to take samples 
- Removed 7 samples of 50ul and 1 sample of 1000ul from each flask before changing fluid and placed into the 1.5mL tubes:

- Removed 1.5mL of remaining medium in each flask and discarded it into a 15mL conical. The conical was placed in the autoclave trash when full (should contain virus)
- Added 3mL of 10% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium with antibiotics to each flask gently
- Gently rocked flasks to distribute the medium 
- Placed flasks back in the 23C incubator for another 3 weeks 
- Sample tubes were frozen at -20

**DNA Extractions**

For these DNA extractions I added in 3 samples from the week 12 sampling because I hadn't done extractions on them because of the winter holidays. 

Samples: 

|sample #|day|flask|
|66|day 84|A|
|74|day 84|B|
|82|day 84|C|
|90|day 106|A|
|98|day 106|B|
|106|day 106|C|


All samples were thawed on ice, [this general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/cell-DNA-extraction-protocol.md) was used, and filter tips were used at all times. Since all samples were presumed positive for DiNV, there was no specific order to them. 2 Extraction controls were done at the same time as well. 

**PCRs**

I did not dilute these samples for PCR. The PCR programs were set to 30 cycles. Information on the primers and their programs can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0), but the TPI program had an extension time of 30 seconds. 

**Gel 20240111**

1% gel ran for 35 minutes, 90V.
