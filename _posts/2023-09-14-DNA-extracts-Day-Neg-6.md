title: DNA Extracts and PCRs of Day -6 of DiNV Experimental Evolution

## DNA Extractions and CO1 and p47 PCRs of Day -6 of DiNV Experimental Evolution Samples 

There are 3 samples (replicates of the same flask) that I need to DNA extract and PCR to check to see that these cells are virus negative. 

Note for this DNA extraction the centrifuge was in the fridge and I did not move it, so all spins are at 4C. 

| tube number | day sampled | sample volume |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | day -6      | 50ul          |
| 2           | day -6      | 50ul          |
| 3           | day -6      | 50ul          |

- Thawed samples on ice 
- Chilled cell lysis buffer on ice until cloudy
- Turned on heat blocks to 37C and 65C
- Added 250ul of cold cell lysis solution to each sample tube and pipette mixed 10X
- Incubated the tubes in the 65C heat block for 10 minutes 
- Let tubes get to room temperature 
- Prepared 1mg/mL RNase A from 10mg/mL
    - 9ul molec grade water 
    - 1ul 10mg/mL RNase A
- Added 2ul of diluted RNase A to each tube
- Inverted tubes 25X to mix 
- Incubated tubes on the 37C heat block for 30 minutes 
- Prepared fresh 70% ethanol and 100% isopropanol 
- Labeled 3 new tubes to be the final tubes 
- Added 100ul 100% isopropanol to those final tubes 
- After the 30 minute incubation, took the tubes out and let them come to room temperature 
- Added 100ul of protein precipitation solution to each tube
- Vortexed the tubes for ~5 seconds 
- Placed the tubes on ice for 5 minutes 
- Centrifuged the tube max speed for 3 minutes 
- Transferred the supernatant to the new tubes containing the 100% isopropanol (~400ul)
- Inverted the tubes 50X 
- Centrifuged the tubes max speed 5 minutes 
- Discarded the supernatant (there was no visible pellet in any tube but that is normal for cell DNA extractions)
- Added 300ul of fresh 70% ethanol to each tube 
- Inverted the tubes twice 
- Centrifuged the tubes max speed for 5 minutes 
- Discarded the supernatant 
- Let the tubes air dry for an hour 
- Resuspended the DNA in 20ul of DNA hydration solution 
- Usually here the DNA is left to sit for ~overnight, but I went directly into doing the PCRs 

**CO1 and p47 PCRs**

- A positive and negative control was used for each primer. The positive control was sample 80 which was [previously positive for virus](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/06/20/freezing-exp-1-PCRs.html) 
- All samples, reagents, and primers were thawed on ice, kept on ice, and vortexed and spun down before use
- Master mixes were made on ice
- p47 master mix:
    - 27.5ul GoTaq
    - 1.375ul p47 F
    - 1.375ul p47 R
    - 19.25ul molec grade water
- CO1 master mix:
    - 27.5ul GoTaq
    - 1.375ul CO1 F
    - 1.375ul CO1 R
    - 19.25ul molec grade water
- 9ul of master mixes were pipetted into strip tubes, 5 tubes per mix
- 1ul of DNA was pipetted into their respective tube. The negative control tube got 1ul of molecular grade water 
- The PCR tubes were vortexed and spun down before use 
- Tubes were placed in their respective thermocycler programs ([see here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0)), and p47 was run for 30 cycles 

**20230915**
A 0.7% gel was run (we are trying to cut down on the amount of agarose used and this should work just as well as a 1%), with 40mL of 1X TAE, 0.35g of agarose, and 0.7ul of Midori stain. The gel was run at 90V for 30 minutes:

The cells are negative for virus based off of this PCR.
