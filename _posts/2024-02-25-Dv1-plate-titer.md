## Plating 2 48 well plates of Dv-1 cells for DiNV titering 

Using 2 48 well plates with the interior 20 wells only, meaning I'll need 40 wells of cells. Plates will have this layout:

|   | 1 | 2            | 3                   | 4                   | 5                   | 6                   | 7                   | 8 |
|---|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---|
| A |   | cell control | 10^-1               | 10^-2               | 10^-3               | 10^-4               | 10^-5               |   |
| B |   | 500ul medium | 200ul 10-1 dilution | 200ul 10-2 dilution | 200ul 10-3 dilution | 200ul 10-4 dilution | 200ul 10-5 dilution |   |
| C |   | 500ul medium | 200ul 10-1 dilution | 200ul 10-2 dilution | 200ul 10-3 dilution | 200ul 10-4 dilution | 200ul 10-5 dilution |   |
| D |   | 500ul medium | 200ul 10-1 dilution | 200ul 10-2 dilution | 200ul 10-3 dilution | 200ul 10-4 dilution | 200ul 10-5 dilution |   |
| E |   | 500ul medium | 200ul 10-1 dilution | 200ul 10-2 dilution | 200ul 10-3 dilution | 200ul 10-4 dilution | 200ul 10-5 dilution |   |
| F |   |              |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |   |

- Scraped 1 flask of confluent Dv-1 cells and spun down at 800rpm for 4 minutes in a 15mL conical 
- Removed the supernatant
- Resuspended the cells in 1mL medium 
- Used 20ul in a hemocytometer to count the cells:
    - Q1: 494 cells
    - Q2: 578 cells
    - Q3: 468 cells
    - Q4: 512 cells 
    - Average: 513 cells 
- Total in the 1mL that should be 5,130,000 cells 
- I was not sure how to do the calculation here at the time, I just resuspended all the cells to a total of 10mL 
- Then added 200ul of that mixture to each of the 40 wells in the plate 
    - this ends up being about 100,000 cells per well 
- These cells were let to sit in the 23C incubator overnight before inoculation
