### Testing Kent's 16 Cq DiNV Fluid as and Infection Liquid on _D. innubila_

Kent had me infect 10 males and 10 females with his 16 Cq 115 fluid from his DinnDiNV 1.1 cells. He used these for his sectioning. He let me use the rest of the fluid to test the long term survival of _innubila_ with a poke from this fluid. Because the fluid came from a mix of supernatants from two different cell culture mediums he was trying, we didn't have a control medium to use for the control pokes. So I used just a sterile needle poke (95% ethanol between each poke) for my controls. 

Using the [D. innubila DiNV infection protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191HoBdHh4KhIpoBTmma_ANXZZ6_2NZV3igZB3zYP5ig/edit) as the process for these infections. 

Flies emerged between 4/5 and 4/6. This means they are 6-7 days old for this infection. Two days before, 6 vials were made out with 12 males and 5 females in each. Two vials of 10 males each will get the control poke, and 4 vials of 10 males each will get the DiNV poke.

Fly mortality was measured every day for 2 weeks, and that data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18KNHkRjMwRqvosEb8KE3kL12_xCppiUBnDBcZm3Z48U/edit#gid=0)

Every 3 days, flies were transferred to new food and any dead flies were frozen. At the end of the 2 weeks, all flies in the experiment were frozen. Information on frozen flies can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F5xgs2-ox0CoioZDPFfX4IOE5FqKJZDU2kMEcGIRiwQ/edit#gid=0)

No day 0 flies were frozen because of a lack of flies to use.
