title: Looking for ORI in DiNV

## Investigating Where the Origin of Replication is in DiNV/If its in Our Proposed CRISPR Sites

AT rich regions (so low GC content) are a signature of origins of replication, because the DNA is easier to open up with many ATs

**Viewing in Geneious**

Looked through Geneious software at the regions proposed for Cas9 reactions (grey bars) and viewed GC content with a bin size of 500bp

77kb Region with the field of view somewhat close in:

77kb Region with the field of view zoomed out a bit more:

130kb Region with the field of view somewhat close in:

It looks somewhat likely that the 77kb region is the highest in AT% (lowest GC) in pretty much all of the surrounding areas.
