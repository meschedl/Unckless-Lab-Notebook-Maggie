## Making the pSPIN-BAC E. coli Electrocompetent 

I need to take the bacteria cells that already have the pSPIN-BAC and make them electrocompetent again so I can electroporate them with DiNV DNA. I am basing what I did on the large batch protocol layed out [here](https://barricklab.org/twiki/bin/view/Lab/ProtocolsElectrocompetentCells). 

**20240123 Making Sterile Filtered 10% Glycerol**

- I need to make a total of 320mL, so I decided to make 500mL total 
- Combined 50mL of 100% glycerol in 450mL of molecular grade water in the top of a sterile filter unit from the BioStore (500mL capacity)
- Used the serological pipette tip to mix the glycerol into solution, this took a while
- Used the vacuum to sterile filter the solution through a 0.2um filter
- Kept at room temp until the day of use 

**20240125 Overnight Culture**

- Set up 3 LB tubes with slightly less than 2mL in them
- Added antibiotics:
    - 0.9ul stock Kanamycin
    - 0.55ul stock Chloramphenicol 
- Picked 3 colonies from the Colony 1 Chlor + Kan plate (see [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/12/15/pSPIN-BAC-glycerol-and-antibiotic-check.html), was still in fridge) and added to the LB tubes
- Let bacteria grow overnight at 37C

**20240126 Making Electrocompetent Bacteria**

- In the morning prepared a 500mL flask with 100mL of LB:
    - Mixed 250mL of DI water and 5g of Lennox LB with shaking 
    - Aliquoitted 100mL to the 500mL flask 
    - Aliquoited 2mL to a rack of test tubes
    - Autoclaved the LB on the short liquid cycle 
    - Let the flask cool about 30 min before use on the bench and the tubes went in the 4C 
- After cooling, I added the antibiotics needed: 
    - Kanamycin:
        - 100,000mg/mL * X = 20ug/mL * 100mL 
        - X = 0.05mL or 50ul of stock Kanamycin 
    - Chloramphenicol:
        - 50,000mg/mL * X = 20ug/mL * 100mL
        - X = 0.04mL or 40ul of stock Chloramphenicol 
- Mixed the flask with the antibiotics 
- Added 1mL of the overnight culture from one of the LB tubes to the flask 
- Placed the flask in the 37C incubator for 2.75 hours 
- During this time the 10% glycerol was placed in the 4C to cool down 
- After incubation (there was considerable growth/clouding of the media) the fluid was transferred to 2 50mL conicals and placed on ice 
- The following processes were done in the Egan Lab to use their centrifuge 
- Fast cooled their centrifuge while the bacteria was chilling on ice 
- Centrifuged the two 50mL conicals at 6,000rpm for 5 min at 4C 
- The supernatant was poured in a flask that would later be autoclave sterilized to pour the liquid down the sink 
- Added 40mL of cold 10% glycerol (kept on ice) and resuspended the pellets with a lot of vortexing 
    - At this point I thought the spin was too strong because the pellets did not resuspend easily 
- Centrifuged 3 min 4C 4000 rpm
- Poured off supernatant into waste, pellet kind of came off so I didn't pour off everything 
- Added 40mL of cold 10% glycerol (kept on ice) and resuspended the pellets with a lot of vortexing
- Centrifuged 3 min 6000rpm 
- Poured off supernatant into waste, pellet kind of came off so I didn't pour off everything 
- Added 40mL of cold 10% glycerol (kept on ice) and resuspended the pellets with a lot of vortexing
- Centrifuged 4 min 6000rpm 
- Poured off supernatant into waste, pellet kind of came off so I didn't pour off everything 
- Added 40mL of cold 10% glycerol (kept on ice) and resuspended the pellets with a lot of vortexing
- Centrifuged 7 min 6000rpm
- Poured off everything in the supernatant into waste even though I lost some bacteria 
- Resuspended each pellet in 500ul of cold 10% glycerol 
- Aliquoited resuspention 50ul into 21 cryo tubes on ice
- Aliquoited resuspention 100ul into 3 cyro tubes on ice
- Froze cryotubes at -80 for storage until use later
