title: Cell Culture Work and Cell De-clumping 
---

## Fluid Changes, Passing Cells, and Trying De-Clumping of DinnDiNV 3.0 and 3.1 Cells 

All work was done in the cell culture hood using sterile technique 

**Fluid Changes**

- ~3mL of fluid was removed from _D. innubila_ primary flasks 1, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 
- The fluid was placed in 5mL tubes and frozen at -80 in case of using for PCR analysis 
- 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract was added back to each flask 
- Additionally, ~5mL of fluid was removed from DinnDiNV 4, 4.1, 4.2, and 4,3 flasks 
- The fluid was placed in 4 5mL tubes to be frozen at -80 incase of use for virions 
- 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract was added back to each flask

**Scraping 1 flask**

- The 10/4 flask had some areas of growing cells but also some precipitate, so I decided to scrape it and try passing it to a new flask 
- Cell scraped the whole flask, and transferred 2mL to a new flask 
- Re-fed the old flask with 3mL of 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract
- Gave the new flask 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract 
- The original flask was labeled A and the new flask was labeled A.1 

**Putting supernatant from flasks into new flasks**

- For a number of flasks, I decided to try removed the supernatant that contained a lot of floating clumps of cells and try plating that in a new flask, in the hopes that some of those clumps would settle and begin to grow. This is basically a last ditch effort for these flasks 
- Each flask and it's passaging flask was given a letter
- For each flask, 2mL of medium from the top of the flask was removed and placed in a new flask. The old and the new flasks got replenished to 5mL of fluid with 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract
- Flasks:
    - 02/01 2 original flasks, now flasks H and H.1, and I and I.1
    - 01/12 original flask, now G and G.1 
    - 01/31 original flask, now D and D.1 
    - 09/27 original flask, now C and C.1
    - 12/13 original flask, now B and B.1 
    - 01/24 original flask, now F and F.1
    - 01/25 original flask, now E and E.1 

S2 and Dv-1 cells were also passed on this day (these get passed every week). 

**Cell De-Clumping Methods**

- The DinnDiNV cells grow relatively well, but they are consistently clumpy. This seems to be an issue for me because clumps of cells autofluoresce under the GFP light. I researched ways to de-clump cells, and based off of the reagents we currently have in the lab, I decided to try a DNase 1 treatment and cell straining. I got the idea from [this protocol](https://www.stemcell.com/how-to-reduce-cell-clumping-in-single-cell-suspensions-with-dnase.html#:~:text=Add%20DNase%20I%20Solution%20dropwise,10%20minutes%20at%20room%20temperature.), which I roughly followed. 
- Kent also gave me two flasks this week of presumed negative for virus cells, 3.0 and 3.1 cells. Because these flasks had a lot more cells than the 4s I am working on building up, I decided to use these flasks for the de-clumping
- I tried DNase 1 treatment and cell straining on both flasks, either cell scraped or typsinized 
- For the 3.0 flask:
    - Used the cell scraped on the whole flask 
    - Transferred the liquid to a 15mL tube 
    - Centrifuged for 5 min at 200 rpm 
    - Removed supernatant
    - Resuspended the cell pellet in 600ul 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract
    - Transferred 300ul to a new 15mL tube 
    - Plated one of the 300ul of cells in a new flask with 10mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract 
    - The other 300ul of cells got a DNase 1 treatment: 50ul of Qiagen DNase 1, pipette mixed genetly, and incubated at room temp for 15 minutes 
        - Qiagen DNase 1 is potentially 0.6mg/mL stock, so to get 100ug/mL in solution, that is 50ul in 300ul total vol 
    - After the 15 minute incubation, I added 3mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract 
    - Centrifuged for 5 min at 200 rpm 
    - Removed supernatant 
    - Added 5mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract 
    - Passed the fluid through a 70um cell strainer 
    - Put the flow through liquid in a flask with 10mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract 
    - Resuspended the cells on top of the strainer in 10mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract and put that in a flask 
    - Added 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract back to the original flask up to 10mL
- For the 3.1 flask: 
    - Removed all the medium from the flask 
    - Rinsed the flask with 3mL of trypsin and poured if off 
    - Added 5mL trypsin and waited ~10 min until many of the cells came off the flask 
    - Transferred the liquid to a 15mL tube 
    - Centrifuged for 5 min at 200 rpm 
    - Removed supernatant
    - Resuspended the cell pellet in 600ul 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract
    - Transferred 300ul to a new 15mL tube 
    - Plated one of the 300ul of cells in a new flask with 10mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract 
    - The other 300ul of cells got a DNase 1 treatment: 50ul of Qiagen DNase 1, pipette mixed genetly, and incubated at room temp for 15 minutes 
        - Qiagen DNase 1 is potentially 0.6mg/mL stock, so to get 100ug/mL in solution, that is 50ul in 300ul total vol 
    - After the 15 minute incubation, I added 3mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract 
    - Centrifuged for 5 min at 200 rpm 
    - Removed supernatant 
    - Added 5mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract 
    - Passed the fluid through a 70um cell strainer 
    - Put the flow through liquid in a flask with 10mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract 
    - Resuspended the cells on top of the strainer in 10mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract and put that in a flask 
    - For the original flask: rinsed it with 3mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract, poured it off, and re-added 10mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom extract to keep the flask going 
- All of these flasks I left in the 23C incubator for 2 days before imaging them in bright field, in GFP, and RPF light. Those images can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hicpjY6q7LmndFaax3acetaq_nbNq_BzQn9T2HwI3oo/edit#slide=id.p)
