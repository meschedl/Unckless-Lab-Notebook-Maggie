## DNA Extraction and PCRs on Passage 4 DiNV Used to Inoculate Cells

Rob wanted me to make sure that the virus solution that I gave the cells that I used for DNA extraction for electroporation worked on all the PCR primers I use. So I combined 2 tubes of [passage 4 DiNV aliquots](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RHdErRIw14FFfQLZ-Elngy35rnMQVDSuWZvyMcucVT0/edit#gid=0) for DNA extraction, then ran p47, 115, lef 4, and lef 9 PCRs on it. 

DNA Extraction followed exactly [the general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/cell-DNA-extraction-protocol.md) except that DNA was only resuspended for 30min before use in PCRs 

4 PCRs were run on the samples, and the process followed the [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) completely. Master mix volumes can be found:

|reagent|p47|11|lef 9|lef 4|
|---|---|---|---|
|GoTaq|17.5ul|17.5ul|17.5ul|17.5ul|
|F primer|0.875ul|0.875ul|0.875ul|0.875ul|
|R primer|0.875ul|0.875ul|0.875ul|0.875ul|
|molecular grade water|12.25ul|12.25ul|12.25ul|12.25ul|

All PCR programs were run for 35 cycles and program information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0). 

A 1% gel was run at 90V for 45 minutes to resolve the bands:
