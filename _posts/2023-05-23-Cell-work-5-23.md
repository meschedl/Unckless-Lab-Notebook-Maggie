## Cell Culture Inventory And Plating 3.1 Cells for Transfection on 5-23

**Cell Culture Inventory**

3/22 ovaries 
- 1 flask 
- Flask full of debris
- I don't see any alive cells 
- Flask was thrown out 

4/3 and 4/11 primaries 
- 2 flasks for each date
- Supernatant flask is very full of debris 
- Other flask is mostly full of dead cells, doesn't seem like anything is alive in either flask 
- Flasks were thrown out 

1.1 innubila P2 
- 1 flask 
- A couple of good areas of growing cells
- Want to fluid change 
- This flask may have enough cells to scrape and try re-plating again

1.2 innubila P2
- 1 flask 
- Some small clumps of cells growing ok 
- Want to fluid change

1.2.1 innubila P3
- 1 flask

1.3 innubila P2
- 1 flask 
- Has a good number of good looking areas of cells, but this flask also has more precipitate than other flasks 
- Want to fluid change

1.3.1 innubila P3
- 1 flask

1.5 innubila P2

1 innubila P1 from 1/12
- 1 flask 
- Basically this flask is entirely full of precipitate
- Flask was thrown out 

G and C innubila primaries 
- 3 flasks 
- All are very full of precipitate 
- Flasks were thrown out 

E, D, and G.1 innubila Primaries 
- 3 flasks
- Many dead cells and precipitate with nothing growning 
- Flasks were thrown out 

**Passing 14091 Myd88 cells**
- Cell scraped p26 flask 
- Used 1mL to seed 2 new flasks 
- Each flask was suspended with 5mL of 10% FBS Schnedier's medium 

**Fluid Exchanges**
- Removed 3mL from each flask 
- Added back in 3mL of 20% FBS, 4% mushroom broth Schneider's medium 
- Flasks:
    - 1.1
    - 1.2
    - 1.2.1
    - 1.3
    - 1.3.1
    - 1.4
    - 1.5

**Plating 3.1 Cells in Plate 9**
- Wanting to do another transfection experiment, so I want to use the 3.1 cells in a 12 well plate 
- Took the 3.1 P3 flask and poured of the medium 
- Added 5mL trypsin and immediately poured off 
- Added 5mL trypsin and waited ~5-10 minutes for the cells to release from the bottom of the flask 
- Sucked up the liquid and put it into a 15mL tube 
- Centrifuged the tube for 5 min at 200rpm 
- Removed the trypsin 
- Resuspened the cells in 10mL of 10% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium 
- Ran the cell fluid through a 70um filter
- Resupended the cells stuck on the filter in 10mL 10% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium and added that to 2 new flasks for a passage 4
- For the 10mL fluid that went through the strainer, 1.5mL of this was added to wells A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, and C3 of plate 9 (see layout)

**Passing 4.3 DinnDiNV cells**
- I make sure to finish all of my other cell work before starting on these cells because they are persistently infected with DiNV
- Going to use trypsin to pass these cells 
- Poured off the medium 
- Added 5mL trypsin then poured it off
- Added another 5mL trypsin and waited ~5-10 min for the cells to release from the flask 
- Added the fluid to a 15mL tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 200rpm 
- Removed the supernatant from the cell pellet 
- Resuspended the cells in 12mL 20% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium 
- Separated out that fluid into 2 new flasks for passage 2
