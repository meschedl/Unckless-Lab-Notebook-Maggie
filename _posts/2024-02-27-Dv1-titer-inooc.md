## Serial Dilutions on Dv-1 Cells with Middle Band and P5 Concentrate DiNV Stocks for Virus Titering 

- Two 48 well plates had been [previously plated](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/02/25/Dv1-plate-titer.html) to the appropriate layout: 

|   | 1 | 2            | 3                   | 4                   | 5                   | 6                   | 7                   | 8 |
|---|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---|
| A |   | cell control | 10^-1               | 10^-2               | 10^-3               | 10^-4               | 10^-5               |   |
| B |   | 500ul medium | 200ul 10-1 dilution | 200ul 10-2 dilution | 200ul 10-3 dilution | 200ul 10-4 dilution | 200ul 10-5 dilution |   |
| C |   | 500ul medium | 200ul 10-1 dilution | 200ul 10-2 dilution | 200ul 10-3 dilution | 200ul 10-4 dilution | 200ul 10-5 dilution |   |
| D |   | 500ul medium | 200ul 10-1 dilution | 200ul 10-2 dilution | 200ul 10-3 dilution | 200ul 10-4 dilution | 200ul 10-5 dilution |   |
| E |   | 500ul medium | 200ul 10-1 dilution | 200ul 10-2 dilution | 200ul 10-3 dilution | 200ul 10-4 dilution | 200ul 10-5 dilution |   |
| F |   |              |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |   |

- The same layout was used for each 48 well plate, one uses the middle band stock generated from the virus purification Kent and I tried, as well as the Passage 5 DiNV that went into the purification effort 
- I was not sure what dilutions to do so I just went 10^-1 through 10^-5 and would do more if needed, there was no way to know how concentrated it was before this! 
- Everything was done in the cell culture hood 
- Prepared 50mL of serum free medium: 49.5mL schenider's medium and 50ul gentamincin 
- Prepared autoclaved 1.5mL tubes for dilitions 
- Dilutions for both solutions were prepared in the same way, but were done separately so to not get confused 
    - Thawed aliquot of solution on ice 
    - Put 990ul serum free medium in 1.5mL tube 
    - Added 110ul virus stock to tube - 10^-1 tube 
    - Vortexed and spun down 10^-1 tube
    - Added 990ul serum free medium to 4 more tubes and labeled for other dilutions 
    - Added 110ul of 10^-1 tube to the 10^-2 tube
    - Vortexed and spun down the 10^-2 tube
    - Added 110ul of 10^-2 tube to the 10^-3 tube
    - Vortexed and spun down the 10^-3 tube
    - Added 110ul of 10^-3 tube to the 10^-4 tube
    - Vortexed and spun down the 10^-4 tube
    - Added 110ul of 10^-4 tube to the 10^-5 tube
    - Vortexed and spun down the 10^-5 tube
    - Kept on ice before using 
- Cleaned out a plastic tray with ethanol before putting in hood and filling with autoclaved paper towels 
- Dumped out the fluid from 1 of the Dv-1 48 well plates into the tray and tapped down on PTs twice 
- Added 200ul of either serum free medium or dilution (see layout above) to each well with cells 
- Filled outer wells of the plates with DPBS 
- This process was done for both plates, one with middle band DiNV solution and one with P5 DiNV solution 
- Both plates were put in the 23C incubator for 48 hours
