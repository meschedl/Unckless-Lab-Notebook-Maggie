title: Testing Experimental Evolution Primers on Unextrated Samples

## Testing 3 Different Primers from Experimental Evolution Project on Supernatant Samples Before Extraction 

Rob suggested that I try some of the primers ([tested out here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/11/02/Testing-Experimental-Evolution-Primers.html)) with the supernatant fluid unextracted. Because [I took so many samples](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/11/07/week-6-exp-evo-sampling.html) at day 42, I decided to take 3 50mL samples and test 3 primers on them. 

I used the [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md), and instead of using 1ul of extracted DNA , I used 1ul of unextracted supernatant as the sample. I used samples , as well as a positive and negative control. 

I used primers 120-DiNV-2, 40-DiNV-2, and 130-DiNV-2. Primer information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0). Each program was for 30 cycles. Afterwards, a 1% gel was run to see amplification. Note there are some other samples on this get, but the first three sets are from this project:

This indicated that I cannot use unextracted sample for these PCRs, which is a bit of a bummer.
