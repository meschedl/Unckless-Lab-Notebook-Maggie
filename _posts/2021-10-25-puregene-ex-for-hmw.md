title: Regular DNA Extraction on Samples for HMW
---

### Using the Puregene Cell and Tissue Kit to Extract DNA from the DiNV Positive and Cell Control Samples to Get a Baseline of Extraction Efficiency

**Notes**
- Following a mix of the bacterial and the 15 flies protocols from the lab drive because my samples are in liquid from
- After looking at the sample volumes, I decided to try 300ul again to match the previous HMW extraction, and it looked like I had a little over 1mL left in the samples so I thought that volume would still leave me with enough volume for another HMW extraction attempt
- Samples were kept in the fridge overnight (plan to do HMW extraction the next day) to avoid another freeze-thaw cycle
- Samples still are:
  - Pos: DiNV GS 2.1 FH 240hr Flask 7-18-2018
  - CC: DiNV GS 3 240hr CC Flask 7-18-2018

**Steps**
- Thawed samples on ice
- Transferred 300ul of each sample to new 1.5mL tubes
- Centrifuged tubes for 30 seconds at 13,000 rpm
- Visible cell pellet after this
- Removed the supernatant
- Added 300ul cell lysis solution to each sample and pipetted to mix/break up the pellet
- Made diluted RNase A (need 4mg/mL)
  - 24ul molec grade water
  - 1ul 100mg/mL RNase A
- Added 1.5ul diluted RNase A
- Vortexed and spun down samples
- Incubated samples at 37 degrees C for 40 minutes
- After incubation, placed tubes on ice for 1 minute to chill
- Added 100ul of protein precipitation solution to each tube
- Vortexed tubes for 10 seconds
- Placed tubes on ice for 5 minutes (tubes got cloudy)
- Centrifuged tubes for 3 minutes at 14,000rpm
- Visible white pellet after this
- Made 2 new tubes with 300ul of isopropanol in each
- Moved ~330ul of supernatant to the new isopropanol tubes
- Inverted tubes ~50 times to mix
- Centrifuged tubes at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes
- Not really able to see a pellet after this
- Removed supernatant as best as possible
- Added 300ul of 70% ethanol to each tube
- Inverted tubes to wash
- Centrifuged tubes at 14,000rpm for 1 minute
- Again hard to see if there was a pellet
- Removed supernatant as best as possible
- Inverted tubes on a kimwipe for 5 minutes to dry
- Added 25ul of DNA hydration solution to each tube
- Pipette mixed and let DNA sit overnight on the bench to resuspend


**Qubit 20211026**
- NOTE: written protocol is incorrect: should have let the pellets dry from ethanol for at least half an hour. My samples may have had poor resuspension because of left over ethanol
- I might have to re-dry my samples then resuspend them to get a better idea of the quant
- This also means I should probably increase the drying time of the HMW extraction after the ethanol wash because of the same issue
- Qubit anyways to see what I have:
  - POS: 21.6ng/ul
  - CC: 3.44ng/ul
- With 25 total ul, this means I got 540ng and 86ng total DNA respectively. This is more than with the HMW extraction and with the same amount of input. So I should have gotten more DNA with that. However this yield is still less than what should be expected based off of the estimates of numbers of cells in these volumes
