## Inventorying cells during the week of Feb. 3rd 2023 

Inventory of cells and plans for how to care for them the next week. 

**9/27 innubila primaries**
- 2 flasks
- One flask is looking better than the other, one has a some good areas with growing cells 
- The other flask seems to have a lot of alive clumps of cells, but not a lot are settled. This flask I want to fluid change and re-plate the old fluid into a new flask
- The other flask that looks better will get a regular fluid change

**01/12 innubila primaries**
- 2 flasks, fairly new
- Still has a clump of cells contracting cells 
- Not a lot of clumps have settled, but they are alive clumps of cells 
- Needs fluid change

**01/13 innubila primaries**
- 2 flasks, new
- Has a lot of alive clumps of cells 
- Probably too new to expect much 
- Needs fluid change 

**09/13 supernatant flask that was scrapped and re-fed**
- Not sure how well this is doing, hard to tell what was scrapped up 
- Lots of debris is present I think
- And not a lot of cells are growing, not sure if this is because they died or because they were disrupted/scraped 
- Needs fluid change 

**01/18 from the scraped 09/13 flask**
- 2 flasks
- Also hard to tell what is going on, if there are much alive cells anymore 
- But in each flask there is one area of growing out cells

**01/24 and 01/25 inubila primaries**
- 2 flasks for each date
- Not much going on at all, but this is probably too early to tell
- Fluid change both 

**12/13 innubila primaries**
- 2 flasks 
- The supernatant flask has a lot going on, but it's hard to tell if it is debris and dead cells, or a lot of alive cells all on top of each other. I want to try scraping and replating this flask into two new flasks. One with mushroom extract and one without 
- The other flask has a live cells and clumps that are settled, but not much growth. Fluid change this flask 

**12/14 innubila primaries**
- 2 flasks
- Basically the same as for 12/13 flasks, could be very promising but hard to tell. Scrape and replate  the supernatant flask and just fluid change the other flask 

**08/11 and 08/18 innubila primaries**
- 2 flasks for 8/11 and 1 for 8/18
- Not much going on in these flasks, but the cells do seem to be still alive. Just in floating clumps still 
- Needs fluid changes 

**9/20 innubila primaries**
- 2 flasks
- Not much in these flasks, lots of floating clumps of cells 
- One clump of cells in one of these flasks is growing out a little bit 
- Needs fluid changes 

**05/02 innubila primaries**
- 2 flasks
- Note sure what to do with these, there are some nice areas of cells but just so so much precipitate 
- I might try to do a targeted scrape of these flasks to just bring up the cells and not the precipitate 

**08/31, 08/30, and 09/21 innubila primaries**
- 1 flask of each 
- Basically no growing out cells, just all floating clumps 
- Decided not to keep trying with these flasks, thrown out 

**10/05 innubila primaries**
- 3 flasks 
- The supernantant flask was just overrun by debris 
- The other two flasks have a lot of precipitate
- All three were thrown out

**10/04 innubila primaries**
- 3 flasks
- 1 flask did not seem to have any alive cells and was thrown out
- The supernatant flask is either full of debris or many clumps of cells, going to scrape this flask and replate it into 2 new flasks 
- The other flask has some larger areas of growing out cells that look nice (see pics)

I did not look at flasks made this week.
