## Generating Primary Cells from _D. innubila_ Dissected Ovaries

This process generally followed the same method as the [previous ovary primary cell generation](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/02/16/Ovary-Primary-Cell-culture-innubila.html) with some differences. 

- Isolated out 100 females into empty vials, 5 flies per vial about an hour before starting so the would hopefully poop out much in their guts
    - Females were age “4”
- Prepared:
    - a small beaker with room temp Schneider's medium 
    - a dish with 70% ethanol
    - a dish with DI-water
    - a 15mL tube with room temp Schneider's medium and a transfer pipette
- Used microscope slides and dissecting forceps
- Steps of each dissection:
    - Put a drop of medium on the microscope stage
    - Placed a blank glass slide on the water drop
    - Added a drop of medium to one side of the slide
    - Put one vial of flies to sleep on the CO2 pad
    - Took a fly with forceps and dipped it into 70% ethanol, and then into the DI water
    - Placed the fly on the droplet of ringers on the slide
    - Use the forceps to try to pull off some tergets on the abdomen of the fly while holding the thorax with the other forcep
    - Tried as best as possible to squeeze out the ovaries and not break the gut
        - This was tough, many flies just fell apart as I dissected, or had small ovaries that I had to dig through the gut to get to
    - Picked up the isolated ovaries and put time into the beaker of Schneider's medium 
    - Dipped the forceps in 70% ethanol
- This was repeated for ~ 75 flies, I'm not sure how many I got through but it wasn't all 100. This took me about 2 hours at least
- Then the beaker with the ovaries was taken to the cell culture hood in 4012
- There I had fly extract, mushroom extract, and mediums warmed to room temperature
- Put a mesh 100um cell strainer in an autoclaved flask and poured the ovaries in through the mesh. To get any stuck on the beaker I used DI water to wash them into the strainer
- Squirted 70% ethanol over the strained ovaries for about 1 minute to try to sterilize them
- Washed the ovaries out into a 50mL conical with 7mL of 10% FBS Schneider’s medium
- Put that liquid into a 10mL glass tube and let the ovaries settle 
- This time they didn't fully settle on their own, so I centrifuged them at 400rpm for 3 min (still not all settled but it was still easy to pipette out the liquid)
- Removed all the liquid from the 10mL tube
- Washed the ovaries again with 7mL of 0% FBS Schneider’s medium and centrifuged again
- Removed all the liquid from the 10mL tube
- Added 3mL of 10% FBS Schneider’s medium
- Transferred the liquid and ovaries to the 7mL dounce homogenizer
- Homogenized the ovaries as thoroughly as possible
- Added 5mL of 10% FBS medium to the dounce and pipette mixed 
- Added another 100um mesh cell strainer over a new 50mL conical and pipetted the homogenate through the strainer 
- Then I released the strained cells into a new 50mL conical with 5mL 10% FBS medium 
- This left me with a conical with filtered cell homogenate (from the top of the filter) and the flow through cell homogenate 
- I put the filtered cell homogenate in 1 T25 flask with 10% fly extract and 10% FBS Schenieder's medium, 10mL total volume 
- I split the flow through cell homogenate in 2 T25 flasks, each with 10% fly homogenat and 10% FBS Schneider's medium at 10mL, and one also had 4% mushroom extract 
- All flasks were put in the 23C incubator
