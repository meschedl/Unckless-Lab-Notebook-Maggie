## Set up Fly Cage With Kent (watching) 2021 10 06

**Notes**
- Flies for today: myd88
- Using the 3 original vials/flies (beginning of the box)
- Did this about 2pm (want to give them less than 24hrs to lay

**Process**
- Plugged n the hose for CO2 and turned valve for bubbler
- Tapped down 1st fly vial, un-cottoned it and flipped it over onto the CO2 plate
- Waited until these files at the plate stop moving, moved the vial to the empty space on the plate and tapped again (repeat to get all flies out of the vial)
- Used a paint brush tool to move the flies to a corner of the plate
- Repeated to get the flies out of the other two vials
- Unscrewed the red end of the fly cage and put in the yeast plate (from yesterday) so it rests well
- Tipped the CO2 plate into the clear end of the cage and tapped in the files (used brush for remaining flies)
- “Capped” the cage with the red end that has the yeast plate in it
- bKept the cage horizontal, rotating it gently for ~2min so the files can wake up on the plastic
- When most of the files were awake, gently set the cafe upright (red on bottom) and left it there for overnight in the fly room on the bench
- Unplugged the CO2 line and turned it off
