title: DNA Extracts from Myd88 Cell Infection
---

## DNA Extractions from Myd88 and Dv-1 Cells Infected with DiNV Day 0 and Day 5 

Cells were inoculated [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/17/innoc-myd88-cells.html). 

- Thawed 24 well plates on ice slowly
- Pipette mixed each well and took 50ul for DNA extraction into a 1.5mL tube
- The remaining ~1mL was added to a separate tube (see sample info below)
- The 1mL tubes were frozen and the 50mL tubes were used for extraction 
- I also thawed samples that were concentrated with the ultrafiltration filters for DNA extraction ( samples A - L, see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1viCPoqCRc1J0kAJH_6797W-w96c_8XWueP33OutgG-Q/edit?gid=0#gid=0) for information)
- All samples for DNA extraction recieved 1ul of 1:1000 diluted lambda DNA 
- Extractions followed the [cell extraction protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/cell-DNA-extraction-protocol.md) exactly
