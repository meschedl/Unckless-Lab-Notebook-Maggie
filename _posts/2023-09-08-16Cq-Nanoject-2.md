## Testing Nanoject II Infections with 16Cq DiNV on D. innubila For a Second Replicate

The [first round of infections](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/09/01/16Cq-Nanoject-1.html) seemed to go ok, so I decided to do a second replicate of the infections. Rob also wanted me to expand my day 0 samples, so I did 10 day 0 males with the injection for DiNV, and I also included 10 day 0 males poked with the needle dipped into the DiNV solution. Additionally, Kent asked me to infect 10 males and 10 females, and control inject 4 males and 4 females. So those were added in as well.
I did my best to make sure the infection went sterilely with the new method. Two days before I separated out flies into easy vials to use for infections:
    - 10 vials of 10 males 
    - 1 vial of 10 females 
    - 1 vial of 5 males 
    - 1 vial with 5 males and 5 females 
    - These flies had emerged 9/1-9/4

**Set up area**
- Thawed 16Cq virus on ice and changed gloves after touching 
- Made 11 new vials of mushroom food 
- Wiped down fly room bench with 95% ethanol before using/putting things on it
- Things taken to the fly room 
    - tube rack with 10 tubes for day 0
    - mineral oil
    - sterile Co2 pad
    - pulled needles
    - sterile forceps (2)
    - two sets of gloves
    - 95% ethanol
    - Nanoject 
    - autoclaved toothpicks
    - Notebook
    - Virus and control medium on ice 
- Used one of the forceps to clip off the tip of one of the pulled needles
- Used the metal needle to backfill the pulled needle with mineral oil, avoiding any bubbles 
- Placed the pulled needle on the machine
    - Slide the collet onto the needle
    - Pushed the 2nd o-ring onto the needle
    - Slid the needle onto the machine 
    - Tightened the collet down 
    - (this method is easier than pushing the needle through the ring on the machine)
- Ejected the mineral oil until the beep
- Filled the needle with control medium (10% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium with antibiotics)
- Tested needle to make sure fluid ejects when pressing inject 

**Injecting flies**
- Placed 1st vial of 5 flies on CO2
- Separated out males with toothpick
- Injected each fly with 27.6nl control medium 
- Placed each fly in 1.5mL tubes with forceps, dipped in 95% ethanol between each fly 
- Placed 1st vial of 10 flies on CO2
- Separated out males with toothpick
- Injected each fly with 27.6nl control medium 
- Used toothpick to place flies in new vial 
- Repeated steps for 2 more vials for all the control flies 
- Repeated steps for the vial of 4 males 4 females for Kent
- This time I was able to eject the rest of the medium, and refill the needle with the 16Cq virus fluid. I think some bubbles got into the needle at this time but I proceeded anyways (this might not have been the correct choice)
- For virus infected flies, infections went the same way:
- Placed vial of 10 flies on CO2
- Separated out males with a newtoothpick
- Injected each fly with 27.6nl 16Cq virus
- Placed each fly in 1.5mL tubes with forceps, dipped in 95% ethanol between each fly (separate pair of forceps from the control flies)
- Placed next vial of 10 flies on CO2
- Separated out males with the virus toothpick
- Poked them with a needle dipped in the 16Cq virus solution, dipping in after each fly
- Used virus toothpick to place flies in new vial 
- Placed next vial of 10 flies on CO2
- Separated out males with the virus toothpick
- Injected each fly with 27.6nl 16Cq virus 
- Used virus toothpick to place flies in new vial 
- Repeated those steps for 3 more vials for me and the vials of males and females for Kent 

The time of infection and duration on CO2 was recorded for each fly:

Mortality is assessed every day, and flies are transferred on CO2 every 3 days. When transferred, dead flies are frozen. Mortality information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ktbWLPoj1JEZM7izM4Er7jgzjwkFlEYdJ_SgTB8_mmA/edit#gid=0) and frozen fly information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1imXMiBw-FD253GFXX4MIZWnvume3zFPfR_udWlUVo3I/edit#gid=0)
