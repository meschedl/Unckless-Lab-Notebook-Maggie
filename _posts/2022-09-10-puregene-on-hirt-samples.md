## Puregene DNA extraction of [Hirt Phenol Chloroform Extracted Samples](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/09/01/hirt-extraction-test-3.html) To Use For qPCR Comparison


Using the same samples from the [previous Hirt extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/09/01/hirt-extraction-test-3.html), however I used the same volume as input for each extraction this time.

**Steps**
- Thawed samples on ice
- Transferred 400ul of each sample to new 1.5mL tubes
- Centrifuged tubes for 30 seconds at 13,000 rpm
- Visible cell pellet after this, however the pellets in 1.5-2 and 0.75 samples were smaller than 0.5-C sample. This means that the densities of cells in each of these samples are different
- Removed the supernatant
- Added 300ul cell lysis solution to each sample and pipetted to mix/break up the pellet
- Made diluted RNase A (need 4mg/mL)
  - 24ul molec grade water
  - 1ul 100mg/mL RNase A
- Added 1.5ul diluted RNase A
- Vortexed and spun down samples
- Incubated samples at 37 degrees C for 40 minutes
- After incubation, placed tubes on ice for 1 minute to chill
- Added 100ul of protein precipitation solution to each tube
- Vortexed tubes for 10 seconds
- Placed tubes on ice for 5 minutes (tubes got cloudy)
- Centrifuged tubes for 3 minutes at 14,000rpm
- Visible white pellet after this
- Made 3 new tubes with 300ul of isopropanol in each
- Moved ~330ul of supernatant to the new isopropanol tubes
- Inverted tubes ~50 times to mix
- Centrifuged tubes at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes
  - The only tube with a visible pellet was the 0.5-C sample
- Removed supernatant as best as possible
- Added 300ul of 70% ethanol to each tube
- Centrifuged tubes at 14,000rpm for 1 minute
  - Again hard to see if there was a pellet
- Removed supernatant as best as possible
- Inverted tubes on a kimwipe for at least 30 minutes to dry
- Added 20ul of 10mM tris HCl
- Let DNA sit overnight on the bench to resuspend

**202200911 Qubit**
- Puregene 1.5-2 : 3.72ng/ul
- Puregene 0.75 : 3:57ng/ul
- Puregene 0.5-C : 26.1ng/ul

These are low yields, but this may be because the input volume was small. These are still fine to use for qPCR however.
