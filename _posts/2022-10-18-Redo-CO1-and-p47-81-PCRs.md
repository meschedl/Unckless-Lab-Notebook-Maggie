title: Redo of 81 CO1 and p47 PCRs on DiNV Test Infections DNA
---

## Redoing CO1 and p47 PCRs on DNA from [Single Fly DNA Extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/09/29/dna-extracts-48-innubila-dinv-test.html) and [extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/10/06/more-dna-extracts-48-innubila-dinv-test.html) to Test for DiNV Infection

There had been some suspected contamination of the PCR plates on the previous PCR attempt, so these were redone.

Samples for PCR in the layout they were in for the plates:

|   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4  | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12 |
|---|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|
| A | 119 | 92  | 11  | 28 | 75  | 91  | 52  | 120 | 36  | 31  | 55  |    |
| B | 56  | 64  | 100 | 13 | 76  | 74  | 115 | 48  | 32  | 108 | NEG |    |
| C | 30  | 3   | 77  | 8  | 2   | 53  | 41  | 7   | 110 | 44  | POS |    |
| D | 40  | 102 | 68  | 39 | 54  | 103 | 104 | 101 | 33  | 21  |     |    |
| E | 63  | 98  | 57  | 37 | 25  | 22  | 1   | 4   | 107 | 49  |     |    |
| F | 59  | 106 | 79  | 18 | 15  | 66  | 86  | 29  | 118 | 26  |     |    |
| G | 35  | 117 | 9   | 89 | 17  | 111 | 58  | 94  | 16  | 67  |     |    |
| H | 38  | 81  | 34  | 65 | 113 | 27  | 70  | 71  | 96  | 88  |     |    |


PCR followed [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) using the CO1 and p47 primers, and _n_ number of 90, and cycling conditions indicated [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0). A positive and negative control were included. The plates were not vortexed and samples were pipette mixed with a multichannel.

Gels were run separately for each primer. Orientation of samples were a little weird because of multichannel limitations, however the annotations of the pictures are accurate. 1% gel, 90V, 35 minutes.
