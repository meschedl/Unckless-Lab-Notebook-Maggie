title: pAc5 Transfection of S2 and DinnDiNV Cells
---

## Using Mirus Bio 2020 Reagent to Transfect pAc5 GFP Expression Plasmid into S2 and DinnDiNV Cells 

Using the [TransIT 2020 Transfection Reagent](https://www.mirusbio.com/products/transfection/transit-2020-transfection-reagent) to test if I can get the DinnDiNV cells to express GFP. I will be testing both 1ul of 2020 reagent, and 3ul 2020 reagent. Both of these volumes have worked for other cell types. 

The cells were plated the day before/the week before [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/04/27/Checking-Cells-and-Cell-Work-04-27.html), and [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/05/09/plating-S2-DinnDinV-for-plate-8.html).

**pAc5 concentration 20230502**
- Latest pAc5 extraction was done [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/04/24/pAc5-and-dsRed-midi-prep.html) 
- There wasn't that great yields, but I can combine some of the extractions and concentrate them down into ~9ug aliquiots 
- Combine tubes 1 and 2:
    - 100ul * 51.4ng/ul = 5,140ng
    - 100ul * 47.1ng/ul = 4,710ng
    - total: 9,850ng 
- Combine tubes 3 and 4: 
    - 100ul * 50.2ng/ul = 5,020ng 
    - 100ul * 47.6ng/ul = 4,760ng
    - total: 9,780ng
- Combine tubes 5, 6, and 7:
    - 100ul * 43ng/ul = 4,300ng
    - 100ul * 44.7ng/ul = 4,470ng
    - 100ul * 12.1ng/ul = 1,200ng
    - total: 9,970ng 
- Concentrated with 1X bead clean up and elute in 30ul 
- Concentrated with a second 1X bead clean up and eluted in 10ul of 10mM Tris HCl, so that there are about 10ug in 10ul , or 1ug/ul concentration

**Transfection 20230510**
- All processes were done in the cell culture hood
- The DNA and transfection reagent were thawed, vortexed, spun down, and kept at room temp
- Made 3 master mix tubes with the transfection reagents:
- Tube 1 - controls 
    - 400ul Schneider's medium 
- Tube 2 - 1ul reagent per well 
    - 600ul Schneider's medium 
    - 6ul concentrated pAc5 plasmid 
    - 6ul 2020 reagent 
- Tube 3 - 3ul reagent per well 
    - 200ul Schneider's medium 
    - 2ul concentrated pAc5 plasmid
    - 6ul 2020 reagent 
- All tubes were pipette mixed gently 
- Tubes were left in the cell culture hood for 30 minutes so the liposome complexes could form 
- Then, the reagent mix was added dropwise to the appropriate well:
    - Tube 1: 100ul into wells A1, A2, A3, and A4
    - Tube 2: 102ul into wells B1, C1, B2, C2, B4, and C4
    - Tube 3: 104ul into wells B3, and C3
- The plate was gently rocked back and forth a few times to try to mix the reagent around in the wells 
- Then the plate was placed in the 23C incubator and will be checked every 24 hours 


Every ~24 hours images will be taken with the GFP filter and can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16T5-jcZTfCCs_47QzmH3kgMIh_Ziafh8S8xLRbMcHFE/edit#slide=id.p) and in bulk [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19MUInioLKX7CI0wi34SFRELCW5Oh6NPV)
