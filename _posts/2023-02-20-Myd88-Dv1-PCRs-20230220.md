## 115, RP49, RPL11, and Lambda PCRs on Myd88 and Dv-1 Cell Samples from 12-Well Plate Infection Experiment 

Using samples from [this extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/02/14/dna-extracts-02-14-23.html) from the [Feb. 8th](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/02/08/infecting-Myd88-Dv1-cells-20230208.html) infection experiment. 

**20230220 115, RP49, and RPL11 PCRs**

I think that the RP49 and Lambda primers can use the 115 program for PCR because their Tms are 60 and 62C, meaning a 55C annealing temp should work for them.  
There are 48 samples to run for 115, and 24 for each RP49 and Lambda. I will have to do only 2 of these together because I will also need positive and negative controls for each. 

I designed a 96 well plate layout for 115 and RP49:

|   | 1 | 2  | 3   | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7   | 8  | 9  | 10   | 11  | 12 |
|---|---|----|-----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|------|-----|----|
| A | 1 | 9  | 17  | 25 | 33 | 41 | NEG | 2  | 18 | 34   | NEG |    |
| B | 2 | 10 | 18  | 26 | 34 | 42 | POS | 4  | 20 | 36   | POS |    |
| C | 3 | 11 | 19  | 27 | 35 | 43 |     | 6  | 22 | 38   |     |    |
| D | 4 | 12 | 20  | 28 | 36 | 44 |     | 8  | 24 | 40   |     |    |
| E | 5 | 13 | 21  | 29 | 37 | 45 |     | 10 | 26 | 42   |     |    |
| F | 6 | 14 | 22  | 30 | 38 | 46 |     | 12 | 28 | 44   |     |    |
| G | 7 | 15 | 23  | 31 | 39 | 47 |     | 14 | 30 | 46   |     |    |
| H | 8 | 16 | 24  | 32 | 40 | 48 |     | 16 | 32 | 48   |     |    |
|   |   |    | 115 |    |    |    |     |    |    | RP49 |     |    |

I used sample #8 from the [previous experiment](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/01/26/qPCR-of-DiNV-Infected-Dv1-and-Myd88.html) that had virus replication for the 115 positive control, along with another positive.  
I used sample 16 from the same previous experiment for the RP49 control as a Myd88 sample. 

All samples and reagents were thawed on ice, vortexed, and spun down before use.  
All primers are diluted to 10uM.

    - 0.25ul nuclease free water * 57 = 199.5ul 
- The master mix was vortexed, spun down, and kept on ice
- 9ul of the master mix went into the wells of the plate in the orientation as seen above 
- 1ul of DNA was added to each well from the appropriate sample 
- 1ul of nuclease free water was used as the negative control 
- 1ul of the positive controls were used 
- The wells were pipette mixed with a multichannel

- The plate was sealed with a foil seal and placed in the thermocycler under the 115 program: 
    - 95 degrees C 5 minutes
    - _95 degrees C 30 seconds_
    - _55 degrees C 30 seconds_
    - _72 degrees C 30 seconds_
    - 72 degrees C 5 minutes
    - Hold at 12 degrees C
    - _italic lines are cycled 34 times_
- Afterwards, I noticed that the top and bottom rows of the plate looked like they had evaporated, some a lot and some not so much. I made note so I could re-do those samples.

**20230221 Gels**

2% large gels were run for all samples, I used 2 of them. Each used 160mL of 1X TAE, 3.2g of agarose, and 4ul of Midori stain.  
The first gel has some strange ordering of samples because I used the multichannel that doesn't work very well and some of the evaporated samples didn't pipette at all into the wells (no liquid left)

I scored the results from these gels as either yes, no, or maybe for a band and put the data into [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fi2Mtt8IbXCSx1YuVR9IfkkJxQe9vNylgJKMFb96UTY/edit#gid=0). I then calculated percentages of yes/no/maybe for each "treatment" by collapsing the replicates (three per treatment) so it is either 0%, 33%, 66%, or 100% for yes/no/maybe. Those results are stored [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ncCo3tv83MN0f3u6OO7hrErllC7dfitPR_sNB3Q4OD8/edit#gid=0) and the visualized results in graphs can be seen [here](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/PCR_analysis/20230206-Myd88-Dv1-cell-infections/20230206-Myd88-Dv1-Cell-Infection-Analysis.md)
