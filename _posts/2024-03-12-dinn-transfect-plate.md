## Plating Dinn-1 Cells for Transfection with GFP Plasmid 

- Using a 12 well plate 
- All processes took place in the cell culture hood
- Took a confluent flask of cells and cell scraped it 
- Removed fluid from flask to 15mL conical 
- Centrifuged conical for 5 minutes at 200rpm 
- Discarded supenatant
- Resuspended the pellet in 1mL of fresh medium 
- Passed the 1mL of cell mixture through at 22 gauge needle and syringe 20 times 
- Increased medium volume to 10mL 
- Added 1.5mL of cell mixture to the last two columns of wells in the 12 well plate 
- Placed plate in the 23C incubator for a few days for the cells to grow
