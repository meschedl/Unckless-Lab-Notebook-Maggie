## Second Infection Test on D. innubila with DiNV Positive Fluid from Primary innubila Cells Day 26

Because there is some evidence that I may not be poking hard enough, I wanted to do the DiNV infection experiment again. Additionally, because sugar agar was not the right food, the mortality data was very messed up. Now I want to keep these flies on mushroom food where the control flies shouldn't die. I also included two controls, flies that were not poked and flies poked with sterile cell culture medium. I started with 13 vials of innubila with ~10 males in each. They emerged 10/7-10/10 meaning they are 5-7 days old. I ended up making 12 experimental vials, and freezing some day 0 flies from the 13th vial.

I tried to relax as much as possible and take my time poking the flies, making sure the whole point of the needle went into the fly and a little bit more. Infections followed [this general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/bacteria_fly_infections.md) however no bacteria was used, just sterile cull culture medium or the fluid from primary innubila infected with DiNV after day 26.

Infections followed as:

Every 3 days flies were transferred to new food, and all dead flies were frozen individually in tubes. All transfers occurred on CO2.
