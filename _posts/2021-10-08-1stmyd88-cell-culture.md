title: First Try Collecting Eggs and Preparing Cell Culture on My Own, Myd88 Files
---

## Second day of Myd88 laying and cell culture prep

### Collecting Eggs and Filtering
- Took out 420 medium with and without FBS from the fridge and placed in the hood to warm up to room temp
- Opened hood, turned on blower and UV light for 10 minutes
**NOTE** mediums should not be in the hood while the UV is on, I made this mistake and put them on the bench after a few min in the hood
- Went to the fly room to collect eggs
- Plugged in CO2 hose, turned on valve
- Tipped over cage onto the CO2 plate and tapped until all the files were asleep
- Took out the red end of the cage and the plate
  - Covered the plate immediately
- Dumped the sleeping flies into the morgue
- Took plate to 4012
- Made a small beaker of 70% ethanol, and picked off dead flies from the plate into the beaker
- Set up the filter rig: autoclaved erlenmeyer flask, 100um filter, 400um filter, then the funnel
- Squirted water into the plate and began mixing up the yeast with a paint brush
**NOTE** I did not make the 50% bleach solution before starting, Kent did it for me while I was filtering. 10mL bleach and 10mL 1X wash  
**Also note** I was using the paint brush at a flat angle but it might be better to use an upright angle
- Tipped over the plate into the funnel and squirted water to wash the liquid down
- Not all the yeast was gone so I brushed and rinsed two more times
- Took off the funnel and rinsed the green filter with water
- Took of the green filter and rinsed the yellow with 1X wash for at least a minute
- Flipped the yellow filter over into a new 50mL conical
- Used a serological pipette to add 10mL of the 50% bleach solution to the yellow filter to wash out the eggs
- Immediately used a pasteur pipette and pipetter to transfer the 10mL bleach and eggs to a glass siliconized 10mL tube
- Let the tube sit for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged the 10mL tube for 3 minutes at 400rcf, there was a good pellet of eggs

### In the Tissue Culture Hood
- Set up the vacuum line
- Used vac and silitionized pasteur pipette (SPP) to suck out the supernatant
- Added 10mL 420 medium without serum to the 10mL glass tube and inverted
- Centrifuged the 10mL tube for 3 minutes at 400rcf
- Repeated the wash twice:
  - Aspirated off the liquid with SPP
  - Added 10m: medium without serum
  - Spun 3 min 400rcf
- Aspirated off the liquid until ~200ul left
- Added 2mL of 420 medium **with serum**
- Unwrapped the dounce, placed the glass mortar in a tube rack
**NOTE** Next time I will need a separate rack for the dounce and the 10mL tube because with one it is too easy to put your hand over the opening to the dounce
- Used an SPP with a bulb to resuspend the egg pellet
- Transferred the liquid in the 10mL tube to the dounce with the SPP
- Unwrapped the pestle and put in the dounce
- Set up two new 25cm2 flasks
  - Myd88 P1 primary 10/8 MES
- Added 8mL of medium with serum to one of the new flasks
- Homogenized for ~30 seconds
  - Pushed down on pestle hard and twisted back and forth briefly, pulled the pestle up, then back down again and twisted again. Repeated 2 more times
- Used an SPP and bulb to transfer the homogenized liquid to the flask with medium in it
- Used 5mL serological pipette to mix the medium in the flask 1 time
- Transferred 5mL of the liquid in the flask to the other flask (identical volumes in both flasks)
- Laid flasks flat and placed in the 23 degree C incubator
- Rinsed out:
  - Erlynmyer flask from filtering
  - Dounce homogenizer and pestle
  - Beaker with ethanol
  - Siliconized 10mL glass tube
- Rinsed with tap water and DI, rinsed the glass tube many times to remove stuck eggs
- Those were all autoclaved in program 3
- All pasteur pipettes in the bucket in the TC hood were thrown in the glass disposal box
- Ethanol wiped the hood
- Rinsed the tip bucket in the hood, ethanol spray and dried
