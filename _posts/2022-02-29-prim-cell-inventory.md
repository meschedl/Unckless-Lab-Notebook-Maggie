title: Week of 2022 02 29 Primary Cell Inventory

## Primary Cell Inventory Week of 2/29/22 Check on Flasks and Image

**Innubila**

01/28  
- No visible cells, lots of debris. Did not image

02/03  2 flasks
- There is a lot of debris and some large cells, they don't look very good. While the large cells might be good, there is no evidence of dividing cells
- The debris might be fungal growth
- These flasks were fluid exchanged (3mL) on 02/23

02/04  2 flasks
- Similar to above, lots of debris but also some large cells. I did see a clump of cells beating but again there is not very much evidence that the cells are proliferating well
- These flasks were fluid exchanged (3mL) on 02/23

02/18  1 flask
- Has not been fluid changed
- Not really any alive or at least dividing cells, you can see that cell clumps attach, but that the cells have not really migrated out from there

01/27  1 flask
- Was fluid changed on 02/23 (3mL removed and added)
- A lot of big cells and some growth and proliferation here. Hard to say if things have grown more than the last time I looked.
- Next time these get a fluid change, the supernatant should get put into a new flask

02/24  2 flasks
- Will be fluid changed on 03/03
- Looks like there are some cells and replication
- There is a lot of debris, but I did see a cell clump contracting

02/25  2 flasks
- Will be fluid changed on 03/03
- Same as above, debris is heavy but cells look like they might be alright for now, might be too early to tell

**Melanogaster** - note, the incubator these flasks were in was at 27 degrees on Monday (02/29), I do not know if it had been like that all weekend. I moved them to a 23/24 degree incubator

IMD Null   
01/26  2 flasks
- Many cells but they are not proliferating, and there is a lot of debris
- Had been fluid changed 02/10

01/27   2 flasks
- One flask is completely over-debris'd and probably will amount to nothing
- The other flask might still have some alive cells, and they kind of seem like they are not attached (because so much debris blocking attachment). The supernatant from this flask was transferred to a new flask on 03/02

02/23  2 flasks
- Fluid changed on 03/02 (3mL removed and added)
- Looks like there are still cells alive and ok, might be too early to tell
- There is still a lot of debris settled which might make it hard for cells to grow out

02/24  3 flasks  
- Fluid changed on 03/02 (3mL removed and added)
- Cells still look alive like above, but there is a lot of debris crowding the flask

Domeless  
02/16  2 flasks   
- Was fluid changed on 03/02 (3mL removed and added)
- Some cells, and I thought I saw a clump of cells contracting which is a good sign, but I'm not seeing a lot of growth outside of the clumps

Dicer 2   
02/11  3 flasks
- Was fluid changed 02/23
- Some clumps of cells but they are not growing
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/20220211-dicer2-cc-imaged-20220301.jpeg)
02/10  2 flasks
- Was fluid changed 02/23
- Clumps of cells look like they sort of grew out but then the cells have shrunken or maybe died. I see this in a lot of my flasks. I am pretty sure these aren't happy cells because the flasks that have a lot of obvious growth have larger cells in these aggregates

Myd88   
02/02  2 flasks  
- Was fluid changed on 02/10
- Not very many cells, not looking very good
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/20220202-myd88-imaged-20220301.jpeg)
02/03  3 flasks
- Was fluid changed on 02/10 and 03/02. The fluid from each flask in 03/02 was transferred to a new flask and supplemented with new medium
- Cells seem to be dividing and still alive and happy, these are probably my best flasks (especially for melanogaster)

- Imaged zoomed out to 10X
