## Doing Final CO1 and p47 PCRs on DNA from [Single Fly DNA Extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/09/29/dna-extracts-48-innubila-dinv-test.html) and [extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/10/06/more-dna-extracts-48-innubila-dinv-test.html) to Test for DiNV Infection

Find sample number information [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A4XvwCQ17upaZ2wGPHmgkCmmVXzNUDTmUcOkkRtjpfI/edit#gid=0) and PCR results from all extractions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nydekzynqKl_a4gWGGl5Yk48HwZCY80foRRYmzPV4Q0/edit#gid=0)

PCR followed [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) using the CO1 and p47 primers, and _n_ number of 30, and cycling conditions indicated [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0). A positive and negative control were used. A different positive control were used for each primer as to save my positive for p47.

A 1% gel was run for 40 min at 90V. Note that an end ladder was not added by mistake.
