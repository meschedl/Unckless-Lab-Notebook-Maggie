title: p47_q PCR of DiNV Infection Liquid
---

## p47-q PCR on DiNV Primary Day 15 3-23 Used in [Infecting Myd88 and W1118 Flies](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/05/02/myd88-w1118-dinv-infect.html)

I had previously used the p47_q PCR primers [on the DNA extracted from the infected flies](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/05/17/rp49-p47-myd88-w1118.html), but I did not try to amplify the virus in the actual infection liquid. So I did a separate PCR for that.

- Samples were the infection liquid, and I also did a negative control of water
- Reaction was made on ice
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 11ul GoTaq
  - 0.55ul p47_q F
  - 0.55ul p47_q R
  - 7.7ul molec grade water
- Vortexed and spun down mix
- Added 9ul of mix to 2 strip tubes on ice
- Added 1ul of DiNV Primary Day 15 3-23 liquid to the first tube
- Added 1ul molec grade water to the second tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Placed tubes in the 55TEST program (55 degree anealing temp and 30 sec extension)
- Samples were placed in the fridge overnight

**Gel 20220525**
- 2% gel ran at 100V for ~35 minutes
- And stained for 35 minutes

Amplification at ~115bp is correct. This is positive for DiNV.
