## Test PCRs with New 130kb Region PCR Primers

**20220428 130-3 PCR**

- Using Primers 129778-F and 130860-R
- PCR product should be 1,083bp
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 11ul GoTaq
  - 0.55ul 129778 primer
  - 0.55ul 130860 primer
  - 7.7ul molecular grade water
- Vortexed and spun down mix
- Added 9ul of mix to strip tubes
- Added 1ul 2mL sample DNA to the sample tube
- Added 1ul molecular grade water to the negative tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Placed in the thermocycler DiNV1303 program:
  - 95 degrees C 2 minutes
  - _95 degrees C 30 seconds_
  - _52 degrees C 30 seconds_
  - _72 degrees C 1 minute_
  - 72 degrees C 5 minutes
  - 12 degrees C hold
  - Italics lines are cycled 34 lines
- Program rand for 1 hour and 52 minutes
- Ran on a 1% gel for 35 minutes at 90 volts:

One band at the correct size, this is great!

**20220409 130-4 PCR**

- Using Primers 129666-F and 131122-R
- PCR product should be ~1.5bp
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 11ul GoTaq
  - 0.55ul 129666 primer
  - 0.55ul 131122 primer
  - 7.7ul molecular grade water
- Vortexed and spun down mix
- Added 9ul of mix to strip tubes
- Added 1ul 2mL sample DNA to the sample tube
- Added 1ul molecular grade water to the negative tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Placed in the thermocycler DiNV1303 program:
  - 95 degrees C 2 minutes
  - _95 degrees C 30 seconds_
  - _52 degrees C 30 seconds_
  - _72 degrees C 1 minute 30 seconds_
  - 72 degrees C 5 minutes
  - 12 degrees C hold
  - Italics lines are cycled 34 lines

With no band, I decided to try a gradient PCR next.

**20220504 130-4 Gradient**

- PCR didn't work with 52 degrees, try a gradient under that
- Set up gradient:
  - A: 52 deg
  - B: 51 deg
  - C: 49.5 deg
  - D: 47.4 deg
  - E: 44.6 deg
  - F: 42.2 deg
  - G: 40.8 deg
  - H: 40 deg
- Not going to use row A because I already know it doesn't work
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 75ul GoTaq
  - 3.75ul 129666 primer
  - 3.75ul 131122 primer
  - 52.5ul molecular grade water
- Vortexed and spun down mix
- Aliquoted out 9ul mix into tubes, 2 per temp
- Added 1ul 2mL sample DNA to the sample tubes
- Added 1ul molecular grade water to the negative control samples
- Ran PCR program same as above but with the gradient for the annealing temperature
- Ran a 1% gel for 35 minutes at 90 volts:
