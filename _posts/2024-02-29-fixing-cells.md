title: Fixing Dv-1 Cells for Titering

## Fixing Dv-1 Cells [Inoculated with DiNV](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/02/27/Dv1-titer-inooc.html) For Titering  

- This is 48 hours after inoculation
- Fresh 80% acetone for fixing had [already been made up](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/02/28/solutions-titering.html) and stored at -20C
- Acetone then placed on ice for use 
- Two 48 well plates of inoculated Dv-1 cells were dumped out onto paper towels and tapped down (towels were disposed of in autoclave waste)
- Slowly dripped with serological pipette the 80% acetone into each well that had cells until each well was full 
- Placed plates in -20 freezer for 30 minutes 
- Tapped and dumped out plates again to remove the acetone
- Let the plates dry with the lid open for 20 minutes 
- Placed the plates covered in the -20 freezer overnight
