## Trying P. rettgeri Infections Again on W1118 Flies And Poking Harder

There has been some indication that I am not poking hard enough during infections. I am trying this infection again and making sure to poke a little harder into the fly each time.

Infections followed [this general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/bacteria_fly_infections.md), and the bacteria was grown overnight in liquid cultures, and diluted to an OD of 1 before using. I had two age sets of flies, either ones that had emerged 10/19-10/22 or 10/22-10/24. I spread them out over the treatments.

Infections followed:

| Vial | Treatment | Replicate | Day emerged | Day Infected | time infected | fly age | Original number flies per vial |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | LB        | 1         | 10/19-10/22 | 20221027     | 5:11          | 5-8     | 10                             |
| 2    | OD 1      | 1         | 10/19-10/22 | 20221027     | 5:17          | 5-8     | 9                              |
| 3    | OD 1      | 2         | 10/22-10/24 | 20221027     | 5:24          | 3-5     | 10                             |
| 4    | LB        | 2         | 10/19-10/22 | 20221027     | 5:30          | 5-8     | 10                             |
| 5    | OD 1      | 3         | 10/19-10/22 | 20221027     | 5:40          | 5-8     | 10                             |
| 6    | LB        | 3         | 10/22-10/24 | 20221027     | 5:46          | 3-5     | 10                             |
| 7    | OD 1      | 4         | 10/19-10/22 | 20221027     | 5:52          | 5-8     | 10                             |
