## Testing Conditions for qPCR When doing Adult Fly DiNV Infection Experiments 

[Previous qPCR](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/09/28/poke-vs-inject-qPCR.html) of adult flies tested different dilutions of DNA failed to indicate a good dilution of DNA to use for these experiments. We are running into the issue where some control samples come up with a small amount of fly or virus DNA, and there isn't a good dilution that removes that. That experiment only looked at day0 flies, where the amount of DiNV was very low. For this test we included more controls and also flies who died from the infection. We haven't looked at the qPCR results of flies dead from infection yet.
