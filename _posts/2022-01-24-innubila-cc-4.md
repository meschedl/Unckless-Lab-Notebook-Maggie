## Cell Culture Preparation of D. innubila Eggs

#### 20220124 Making Yeast Plates
- Used yeast paste made the week before
- Then that afternoon, made 2 apple juice yeast plates with 3 very small streaks of yeast on each plate, and these were thin so they would be able to dry well. Also the plates were left for 2-3 nights to dry

### 20220126 Setting up D. innubila Flies to Lay

- I tried to set up these flies in a way where I wouldn't have to knock them out. I took a cage and covered the opening with press n seal, then cut a small V out of one side. Then I used that opening to dump fly vials into
- When I moved a vial, I covered the hole with a cotton ball
- This worked for a while, until there were a lot more flies in the cage and every time I took of the cotton ball a bunch would fly out before I could put in the next vial
- I had to stop adding flies before I had wanted to
- In the last vial I added, the cotton roll feel out into the cage and squished some flies. I knew I had to take it out so I decided to knock out the flies for as quick as possible to take it out
- I probably added 10-15 vials to the cage (but this is less than I usually do for melanogaster)

### 20220127 Day 1 Cell Culture
- Collected the apple juice plate at ~11am and replaced the cage with a new plate for more laying
- Picked out all the eggs on the plate: 154 eggs, and put them in a beaker with egg wash before bringing to 4012 to filter and rinse more throuroughly
- Roughly followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html), but also used the modifications from the [innubila cell culture last week](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/01/10/innubila-laying-plate-test.html) that did not use trypsin and minimized washes
- Made fresh 0% and 20% Schneider's medium with all antibiotics
- 1 flask was made from these cells
- Imaged that afternoon:

### 20220128 Day 1 Cell Culture
- Collected the apple juice plate at ~10am and spread the flies out over 8 vials to keep in my stocks
- Picked out all the eggs on the plate: 127 eggs, and put them in a beaker with egg wash before bringing to 4012 to filter and rinse more throuroughly
- Roughly followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html), but also used the modifications from the [innubila cell culture last week](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/01/10/innubila-laying-plate-test.html) that did not use trypsin and minimized washes
- 0% and 20% Schneider's medium with all antibiotics made yesterday was used
- 1 flask was made from these cells
