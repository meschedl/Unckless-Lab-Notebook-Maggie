title: qPCR of D. innubila Dead from Infection and Test Hirt/Puregene DNA Extractions 
---

## qPCR to Determine Difference in Viral DNA Yield Between the Hirt and Puregene Extracted Dinn Cells, as Well as Adding in Some D. innubila Adults Who Died from DiNV Infection to See Viral Load 

Information on the samples from the Hirt extraction can be found [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/11/14/hirt-extraction-dinn-cells-1.html/). Their corresponding Puregene samples were extracted [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/11/15/puregene-of-hirt-A-B.html) along with a Qubit to determine DNA concentration. Fly DNA used to check the integrity of replicate 2 of the male and female 16Cq injections, [extracted here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/11/09/male-fem-rep-2-16Cq-ex.html), was also used in the qPCR. 

All DNA samples were thawed on ice, then diluted to 1ng/ul if possible. For samples with DNA too low to read on broad range Qubit, they were not diluted.
