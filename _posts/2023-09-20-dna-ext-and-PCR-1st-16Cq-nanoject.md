title: DNA extractions and PCRs on 1st Replicate of 16Cq Nanoject Infections
---

## Single Fly DNA extracts and TPI and p47 PCRs on 1st replicate of 16Cq DiNV Nanoinject infections on D. innubila 

Samples are from [This infection](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/09/01/16Cq-Nanoject-1.html)

Samples were single flies in tubes, and had their DNA extracted with the [DiNV specific DNA extraction protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/single_fly_DNA_extraction_DiNV.md) that takes care to minimize contamination and includes two extraction controls in each round of extraction. DNA extractions were split up over 2 days, on the 20th and the 21st. Information on the order of samples and their extraction dates can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bEz5o2aW3-J1ah_DU8COMTa3vGwMJhmu_RanG1JiZgY/edit#gid=573228117)

After all samples had their DNA extracted, each sample went through PCR for TPI and p47. The [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) was followed, and the primer information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0). The p47 program was for 30 cycles. After, all samples were run on 1% gels for 30 minutes at 90V.
