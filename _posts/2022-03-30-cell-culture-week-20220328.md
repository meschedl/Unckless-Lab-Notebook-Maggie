## Cell Culture Work for the Week of 20220328: Domeless Primary Cell Generation, Fluid Changes, Secondary Transfer, and Inventory

**20220330**
- Prepared primary cell culture from Domeless flies using the [updated primary cell culture protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/03/31/updated-cell-culture-protocol.html). This generated 1 top flask and 2 bottom flasks
- Made new 20% serum medium with 75% old lot # FBS 20% new lot # FBS
- Used the 75:25 medium to do a fluid exchange on:
  - 03/09 domeless bottom 1 flask
  - 03/03 SPZ top and bottom flasks (1 each)
  - 02/23 IMD null (2 flasks)
  - **1 flask** from myd88 02/03
- Used the new lot # 20% FBS to do a fluid exchange on:
  - 03/23 IMD null top and bottom flasks (1 each)
  - 03/24 IMD null top and bottom flasks (1 top, 2 bottom)
- For fluid change
  - Remove 3mL from the flask
  - Add in 3mL new medium
  - Gently redistribute liquid over the flask to mix
- Did a secondary transfer on the other 2 02/03 myd88 flasks, one using a cell scraper and one using trypsin. For both of these I used the 75:25 FBS medium
- Cell scraper:
  - Made a new flask with 10mL of new 20% FBS medium
  - Unwrapped the cell scrapper and used it on the the surface of the flask
  - Gently scrapped sideways across the flask many times until it looked cleared up and there was a lot of visible stuff in the medium
  - Transferred the liquid from the flask into the new flask with the 10mL of medium
  - Pipette mixed the flask
  - Transferred 5ul from that flask into 2 new flasks, making a total of 3 new flasks from the first one
  - Labeled these flasks SC
- Trypsin
  - Poured off the medium from the flask
  - Added 3mL of room temp trypsin to the flask and distributed it over the surface
  - Immediately poured off the trypsin
  - Added another 3mL of trypsin to the flask and distributed it over the surface
  - Incubated the trypsin on the flask for 2 minutes
  - Added 6mL of 20% FBS medium to the flask
  - Pipetted the liquid a couple of times over the flask surface to release the stuck cells
  - Transferred the liquid to a glass 10mL tube
  - Centrifuged the tube for 5 minutes at 200rpm
  - Gently removed the supernatant (pellet was visible)
  - Resuspended the cell pellet in 5mL of 20% FBS
  - Made a new flask with 10mL of 20% FBS
  - Transferred the liquid in the 10mL flask into the new flask
  - Pipette mixed the flask
  - Separated out that flask into 2 more flasks with 5mL each, producing 3 total flasks
  - Labeled these flasks T

**20220331 Cell Culture Inventory**

IMD Null  
- 02/23 (2 flasks)
  - There are some cells in this flask that look alive, but there has been no growth really after a month
  - These flasks were thrown out
- 03/23 top
  - Lots of clumps of cells that look good, but not seeing any evidence of grow out yet
  - These are still "young" so it's worth waiting on them
- 03/23 bottom
  - Saw a clump of cells contracting
  - There are a good number of clumps of cells, just none really growing out and spreading yet
- 03/24 top
  - Lots of debris and not very many cells
  - This flask was thrown out
- 03/24 bottom (2 flasks)
  - Some debris pile up
  - There are some good clumps but not very many cells in these flasks

Domeless   
- 03/09 top
  - Not a lot of cells and no evidence of the cells growing out
  - This flask was thrown out
- 03/09 bottom 1
  - Found a clump of cells contracting still
  - Not a lot of cell growth but I'm going to keep with this one
- 03/09 bottom 2
  - Some clumps of cells but not very many cells, no cells growing out
  - This flask was thrown out
- 03/30 top
  - Lots of single cells and a fair amount of debris too
- 03/30 bottom
  - A good number of single cells and clumps, hopefully these flasks will be good
- 03/31 top
  - Lots of single cells and not a lot of clumps of cells
  - This flask was looked at very recently after generation and there was very little debris (probably not settled yet)
- 03/31 bottom 1 + 2
  - A lot of single cells and a good amount of cell clumps
  - This flask was looked at very recently after generation and there was very little debris (probably not settled yet)

SPZ  
- 03/03 top
  - Lots of debris but there are some cells and clumps alive. I will keep this one going for a bit
- 03/03 bottom
  - I saw a cell clump contracting
  - Lots of clumps of cells and evidence of cells growing
  - Might want to think about doing a secondary transfer on this flask soon, but want to keep an eye on for a bit first

Myd88
- 02/03 original flask (1)
  - Still a good number of cells alive and presumably growing. There are lots of areas of the flask that are covered in a monolayer of cells
- 03/02 fluid transfer from 02/03 flasks (3 flasks)
  - Lots of the huge dark cells that float, I feel like these cells aren't alive?
  - There are a few cells that have settled on the bottom
  - Might be a good idea to fluid change this flask
- 03/30 cell scrape from 02/03 (3 flasks)
  - Hard to tell yet what is going on, they've only been in the flask overnight
  - There are a lot of single cells, some big cell clumps, some of the large floating brown cells
  - There were a few spots with a couple (~6) of the smaller round cells that look like they might have divided out
- 03/30 trypsin from 02/03 (3 flasks)
  - Again, it's hard to tell how these are doing after 1 day
  - There are more clumps in these flasks, and not very many single cells
  - What's surprising is that there's basically no debris! Seems like washing out stuff and centrifuging got rid of it
  - There are some places that look like cells might be growing out, too early to tell

Innubila   

Note: innubila flasks had some things done to them by Kent in the last few weeks, I'm not sure exactly what he did with them but I made guesses from the notes on his flasks

- 03/17 - there should have been 2 flasks but I only have 1
  - Lots of cell debris and hardly any cells at all
  - This flask was thrown out
- 03/18 - I know I made cells this day but I don't have a flask anymore. My guess is that Kent threw it out without telling me. Likely it wasn't a good flask anyways. Or he never gave me back this flask  
- 02/18
  - This was fluid changed by Kent on 3/4 and 3/23
  - There were almost no cells and all debris
  - This flask was thrown out
- 02/24 (2 flasks)
  - Was fluid changed by me on 03/03
  - Lots of those large dark cells that sort of look dead
  - One of these flasks has a lot of growth of the long skinny cells
  - These flasks need another fluid change
- 02/25 (2 flasks)
  - Was fluid changed by me on 03/03
  - Lots of the long stringy cells, the big brown cells, and some smaller round cells
  - These flasks need another fluid change
- 01/13 (1 flask)
  - I'm not exactly sure what happened to this flask. It was fluid changed by me on 02/10, then by Kent on 2/18, 3/2, 3/7, and 3/23
  - It also seems like Kent trypsinized this flask on 3/7, but I don't know why there are still cells left if that happened?
  - Anyways, there are some single cells and also some areas where there are a lot of those small round cells growing out
  - I should fluid change this flask soon
- 01/27
  - This flask was fluid changed by me on 2/23 and by Kent on 3/4 and 3/23
  - This flask has a lot of precipitate crystals from the media
  - But there are still cells that might be a love, round ones and the stringy ones
  - I might try transferring these to a new flask to get rid of the crystals?
- 02/04 (2 flasks)
  - Fluid changed by me on 2/23, Kent on 3/4 and 3/23
  - Lots of debris and floating things, no growing cells
  - These flasks were thrown out
