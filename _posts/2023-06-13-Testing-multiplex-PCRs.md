title: Test CO1, TPI, 115, and p47 in Multiplex PCRs
---

## Testing the Ability to Do Multiplex PCRs of CO1 and TPI, and 115 and p47

I want to test if I can run CO1 and TPI primers in on PCR reaction, and 115 and p47 primers in also the same PCR reaction. This will allow me to test 4 primers on my DNA extractions, while only doing 2 actual reactions per sample. 

For all of these tests I will be using samples 51, 38, 11, and 9 from the [20220915 innubila DiNV infections](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/09/15/innubila-dinv-infec-test.html), where 51 and 38 are virus positive, and 11 and 9 are virus negative. 

**CO1/TPI**

- CO1 is about 750bp and TPI is about 90bp, so they can both be resolved on the same gel
- The primers both have their lowest TMs at 59, so the same annealing temp should be able to be used
- I will use the CO1 program to test these out:
    - **95 degrees C 2 min**
    - **95 degrees C 20 sec**
    - **52 degrees C 20 sec**
    - **72 degrees C 1 min 30 sec**
    - 72 degrees C 5 minutes
    - 12 degree C hold
    - _bold lines are cycled 34 times_
- Each sample was tested with CO1 primers only, TPI primers only, and both primers, as was a negative control
- All samples, primers, and reagents were thawed on ice, vortexed, and spund down before use 
- Made 3 master mixes:
- CO1 master mix:
    - 27ul GoTaq
    - 19.25ul molecular grade water
    - 1.37ul CO1 F primer
    - 1.37ul CO1 R primer
- TPI master mix: 
    - 27ul GoTaq
    - 19.25ul molecular grade water
    - 1.37ul TPI F primer
    - 1.37ul TPI R primer
- CO1 + TPI master mix:
    - 27ul GoTaq
    - 16.5ul molecular grade water
    - 1.37ul CO1 F primer
    - 1.37ul CO1 R primer
    - 1.37ul TPI F primer
    - 1.37ul TPI R primer
- All master mixes were vortexed and spun down and kept on ice during use
- 9ul of the appropriate master mix was added to each tube:

|tube number|sample|primer|
|---|---|---|
|1|51|CO1 only|
|2|51|TPI only|
|3|51|TPI and CO1|
|4|38|CO1 only|
|5|38|TPI only|
|6|38|TPI and CO1|
|7|11|CO1 only|
|8|11|TPI only|
|9|11|TPI and CO1|
|10|9|CO1 only|
|11|9|TPI only|
|12|9|TPI and CO1|
|13|neg|CO1 only|
|14|neg|TPI only|
|15|neg|TPI and CO1|

- Added 1ul of the appropriate DNA sample or molecular grade water for the controls
- Vortexed and spun down the tubes 
- Placed the tubes in the CO1 program (listed above)

**115 and p47**
- 115 is about 100bp and p47 is about 370bp so they should be able to be resolved on a gel togther 
- Both PCR programs use a 55C annealing temp, I decided to go with the 115 program for this trial:
    - **95 degrees C 2 min**
    - **95 degrees C 30 sec**
    - **55 degrees C 30 sec**
    - **72 degrees C 30 sec**
    - 72 degrees C 5 minutes
    - 12 degree C hold
    - _bold lines are cycled 34 times_
- For this I used Kent's 115 stock primers that may need to be diluted 1:100 instead of 1:10 to get 10uM concentration. I decided to test both dilutions of the primers 
- Each sample was tested with p47 primers only, 115 primers only (both 1:10 and 1:100), and both combo sets of primers, as was a negative control
- All samples, primers, and reagents were thawed on ice, vortexed, and spund down before use 
- Made 5 master mixes:
- p47 master mix:
    - 27ul GoTaq
    - 19.25ul molecular grade water
    - 1.37ul p47 F primer
    - 1.37ul p47 R primer
- 115 1:10 master mix: 
    - 27ul GoTaq
    - 19.25ul molecular grade water
    - 1.37ul 115 1:10 F primer
    - 1.37ul 115 1:10 R primer
- 115 1:100 master mix: 
    - 27ul GoTaq
    - 19.25ul molecular grade water
    - 1.37ul 115 1:100 F primer
    - 1.37ul 115 1:100 R primer
- p47 + 115 1:10 master mix:
    - 27ul GoTaq
    - 16.5ul molecular grade water
    - 1.37ul p47 F primer
    - 1.37ul p47 R primer
    - 1.37ul 115 1:10 F primer
    - 1.37ul 115 1:10 R primer
- p47 + 115 1:100 master mix:
    - 27ul GoTaq
    - 16.5ul molecular grade water
    - 1.37ul p47 F primer
    - 1.37ul p47 R primer
    - 1.37ul 115 1:100 F primer
    - 1.37ul 115 1:100 R primer
- All master mixes were vortexed and spun down and kept on ice during use
- 9ul of the appropriate master mix was added to each tube:
