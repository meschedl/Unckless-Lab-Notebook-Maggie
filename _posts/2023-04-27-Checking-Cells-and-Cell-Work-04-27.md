title: Cell Culture Work and Plating D. innubila Cells 04/27

## Fluid Changes, Passing Cells, and More De-Clumping of DinnDiNV 3.0 and 3.1 Cells into Plates 

All work was done in the cell culture hood using sterile technique. Most of the Lettered flasks from the [last cell work](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/04/11/Cell-work-4-11.html) had no growth of cells ad looked mostly dead. All poor looking flasks were thrown out, and any that looked ok were kept and fluid changed (see below). 

**Fluid Changes**

- ~5mL of fluid was removed from D. innubila primary flasks 1, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3
- 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider’s medium with 4% mushroom extract was added back to each flask
- Additionally, ~5mL of fluid was removed from DinnDiNV 4, 4.1, 4.2, and 4,3 flasks
- 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider’s medium with 4% mushroom extract was added back to each 4 flask
- ~3mL of fluid was remoced from D. innubila primary flasks E, C, G.1, and D 
- 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider’s medium with 4% mushroom extract was added back to each flask
- Additionally, ~5mL of fluid was removed from DinnDiNV 3.0 and 3.1 flasks
- 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider’s medium with 4% mushroom extract was added back to each 3 flask

**Scraping 1 flask**

- The G flask had some areas of growing cells, so I decided to scrape it and try passing it to a new flask
- Cell scraped the whole flask, and transferred 3mL to a new flask
- Re-fed the old flask with 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider’s medium with 4% mushroom extract
- Gave the new flask 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider’s medium with 4% mushroom extract


Dv-1 and S2 cells were passed normally, I will wait until DinnDiNV cells have grown up in the plate before plating S2 with them. 

**De-clumping "3" cells and plating in a 12 well dish**

3.1 trypsinized flow through flask 
- Poured off supernatant 
- Added 5mL trypsin, then immediately poured it off 
- Added 5mL trypsin, and waited 7 minutes until the cells released from the flask surface 
- Placed fluid in a 15mL conical, let settle for 1 minute, then took 4mL of fluid of the top fluid off into a new 15mL conical (presumably holding the single cells/small clumps)
- Centrifuged both conicals 5 min 200rpm 
- Removed trypsin
- Resuspended the "top" fluid in 6mL of 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom 
- Ran this fluid through a 70um cell strainer and used the flow through 
- Plated 1.5mL of the "top" fluid into wells A4, B4, and C4 of a 12 well plate 
- The settled cell fluid pellet was resuspended in 5mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom and plated in a new flask 

3.0 cell scraped flow through flask 
- Scrapped whole flask and put fluid in a 15mL conical 
- Let the fluid settle for 1 minute, then took 4mL of fluid of the top fluid off into a new 15mL conical (presumably holding the single cells/small clumps)
- Centrifuged both conicals 5 min 200rpm 
- Resuspended both conicals in 6mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom
- Ran both fluids through a 70um cell strainer and used the flow through 
- Plated 1.5mL of the "top" fluid into wells A2, B2, and C2 of a 12 well plate 
- Plated 1.5mL of the "settled" fluid into wells A3, B3, and C3 of a 12 well plate 

Placed the plate in the 23C incubator to grow for a few days before using for a transfection experiment
