## Hirt DNA Extraction of Dinn Cells Infected with DiNV for 2 Weeks to Prep DNA to use in Electroporation 

**20240110 Inoculating Flasks**

- In the cell culture hood and following sterile technique 
- 2 Flask of Dinn cells passage 11 (no mushroom extract) were made on 12/19 and allowed to grow 
- On the 10th they were inoculated with 90ul of passage 4 DiNV (vials 12-17 in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RHdErRIw14FFfQLZ-Elngy35rnMQVDSuWZvyMcucVT0/edit#gid=0))
- The flasks were rocked to distribute the fluid and left to incubate at 22C for 2 weeks 

**20240124 Harvesting Cells**

- In the cell culture hood and following sterile technique 
- Removed ~6mL from each flask and placed in a 15mL conical, this left about 1-2mL in each flask
- Used a cell scraper to get up as much of the cells that I could in each flask 
- Aliquoited about 600-700ul of solution into 1.5mL tubes:
    - 20: ~600ul of flask C
    - 21: ~600ul of flask C
    - 22: ~600ul of flask C
    - 23: ~700ul of flask D
    - 24: ~700ul of flask D
    - 25: ~700ul of flask D
- Kept these tubes on ice until use a few min later 
- The 15mL conical was frozen at -20 

**20240124 Hirt Extraction**

*Lysis and Chromosomal DNA Precipitation

- The small centrifuge was placed in the 4C at least an hour before use
- All samples were spun down at 2,000g for 3 min 
- The supernatant was removed and put in the 15mL conical of supernatant from earlier and cell pellets were left
- All processes were done in the fume hood
- Added 147ul 50mM Tris HCl, 10mM EDTA to all the samples
- Prepared 5mg/mL RNase A
    - 10ul molecular grade water 
    - 10ul 10mg/mL RNase A
    - Vortexed and spun down to mix
- Added 3ul of 5mg/mL RNase A to each sample
- Added 150ul of 1.2% SDS to each tube
- Inverted tubes, gently resuspended pellet with clipped pipette tips to mix 
- Incubated tubes on bench for ~2 minutes to lyse/digest all cells/virus
    - This seemed to work, the cell pellets had disappeared by 15 minutes, and I had periodically inverted the samples throughout that time
- Precipitated chromosomal DNA and cellular debris by added 210ul of 3M CsCl, 1M potassium acetate, 0.67M acetic acid
  - A white precipitate immediately started forming in the tubes, I pipette mixed the solution with clipped pipette tips
- Immediately placed tubes on ice for 30 minutes incubation 
- Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000rcf at 4 degrees C
- During this time I made fresh 80% and 100% ethanol and put them in the -20 freezer to cool
- Pipetted off supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes 
- Centrifuged new tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000rcf at 4 degrees C
  - There was basically no new precipitate here that pelleted
- Moved supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes

    - 21: 475ul
    - 22: 475ul
    - 23: 475ul
    - 24: 465ul 
    - 25: 475ul 

Phenol Chloroform Extraction

- Still in the fume hood
- Added equal volume of cold phenol-chlorofomr-isoamy-alcohol to the tubes (Note!! phenol-chloroform-isoamy-alcohol is in two phases, I think you are supposed to use the bottom layer for this, see [x](https://hermanlab.unl.edu/protocols/phenolppt.html))
    - 20: 485ul
    - 21: 475ul
    - 22: 475ul
    - 23: 475ul
    - 24: 465ul 
    - 25: 475ul 
- Mixed tubes up and down and then put them on an orbital mixer in the hood for 10 minutes, the samples did become cloudy at this time
- Centrifuged tubes at 16,000rcf at room temp for 15 minutes
- Looked for phase separation
  - Phase separation looked great, there were two distinct layers in each tube, there was a small white layer between the two phases
- Transferred top aqueous phase to new final labeled tubes (did not use clipped tips here for better pipetting )
    - I did not try to get absolutely everything, I did not want to suck up both phases

    - 22: 460ul
    - 23: 460ul
    - 24: 455ul 
    - 25: 460ul 
- Added 0.1X tube liquid volume of new 3M NaOAc to each tube
    - 20: 48ul
    - 21: 45.5ul
    - 22: 46ul
    - 23: 46ul
    - 24: 45.5ul 
    - 25: 46ul
- Added 1000ul of cold 100% ethanol to each tube
- Inverted tubes to mix
- Placed tubes in the -20 overnight

**20240125 DNA Precipitation**

- Took tubes out of the freezer and centrifuged tubes at max speed at 4C for 30 minutes
  - Tubes had not frozen in the freezer
  - Each tube looked like they had a pellet that was pretty visible
- Pipetted off supernatant into a waste container
- Added 500ul of cold fresh 80% ethanol and inverted twice to mix
- Centrifuged tubes at max speed at 4C for 30 minutes
- Pipetted off supernatant into a waste container
- Let tubes dry ~30 minutes upside-down on the bench
- Resuspended pellets in 20ul of 10mM tris HCl and left on the bench a few hours before qubiting 
- Qubit followed [this protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCz0SBof6LHE3P_LbftawFyexl8iCECUlvjIcauPYwY/edit) for broad range reagents
