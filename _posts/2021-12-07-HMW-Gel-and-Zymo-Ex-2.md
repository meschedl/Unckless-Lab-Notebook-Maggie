title: Overnight Gel and HMW "150kb" Gel Extraction
---

## Another Overnight Gel and [Zymoclean Large Fragment DNA Recovery Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymoclean-large-fragment-dna-recovery) on 3mL-120hr HMW DNA Sample


**Notes**  
- Using [3mL-120hr](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/11/23/HMW-Ex-6.html) HMW DNA sample (~115ng/ul)
- Skipped wells in the gel when loading to give ample room for slicing
- Minimized time on UV, tired to slice of extra gel but when I looked at the pieces I sliced, there wasn't a layer of gel! Tried not to look for too long. I sliced out the HMW portion, then took it out of the gel, then turned on the UV to check for a second, then turned it off to slice into the 3 sections
- I implemented all modifications to the Zymo kit to maximize DNA yield and length:
  - Heated elution buffer to 70 degrees C
  - Did two elution centrifuges
  - Incubated elution liquid on the column for >1 minute each time (5 min each)
- Additional things I tried:
  - Incubating the gel slice in the ADB for 10 minutes until 5 to make sure the gel was disolved
  - Did a "dry spin" after the 2nd wash for 1 minute to dry the column of any residual wash buffer (ethanol)


**20211207 Loading and Running Gel**  
- 0.8% gel mix:
  - 180mL 1X TAE
  - 1.4g agarose
- Microwaved for ~4min
- Pipetted 1mL into a 1.5mL tube and saved on the heat block at 65 degrees C **make sure the heat block is on and running**
- Made sure the large tray had well sealed tape barriers
- Let the gel liquid cool for ~10 min until pouring into the tray and placing in the combs
- Gel cooled in ~20 min or less
- Added 1 round of PFG ladder to the left-most well
- Let the 1mL saved gel cool for ~3 min outside of the heat block
- Filled the PFG well with cooled gel liquid to the top of the well to seal the round in
- Waited ~3 minutes for the wells to cool
- Made up 48kb ladder:
  - 1.2ul ladder
  - 6ul loading dye
  - 28.8ul molecular grade water
- Placed the gel tray into the box after removing the tape
- Mixed 3ul of loading dye with 15ul of 3mL-120hr sample (with a clipped tip) and added it to the 3rd well in the gel
- Added 16ul 48kb ladder to the 5th well in the gel
- Set the timer for 16.5 hours at 40 volts and started it at ~5:47pm


**20211208 Gel Slicing and Extraction**
- Stopped the gel at 9am
- Sliced the gel in half and placed the half with samples in the EtBr bath for 1 hour
- While that was in the bath, I made up final tubes and weighed tubes for the starting weight for the gel extraction
- After 1 hour: put on PPE for looking at UV and took picture of the gel
- Cleaned fresh razor blade with ethanol before use
- Quickly sliced out a square of the whole "HMW" section of the 3mL-120hr sample and of the PFG marker, then kept the UV off for all other slicing
- Sliced the 3mL-102hr piece into 3 for "upper", "150", and "lower" sections.
- Gel image and approximate slice positions:

- Looks like the gel ran kind of off angle again, because the 48.5kb positions in the ladders don't line up, but if it did just run slightly off, then what I sliced should have the 150kb piece in it somewhere
- Cleaned up and disposed properly all EtBr touching items
- Weighted every sample tube with the gel in it, and calculated the gel weight, and the 3X gel weight

|tube name|tube weight (mg)| tube weight with gel (mg)|gel weight (mg)|3X gel weight volume (ul)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|3mLB-150|990.9|1070.2|79.3|237.9|
|3mLB-UP|984.7|1038.7|54|162|
|3mLB-LOW|994.7|1040.9|46.2|138.6|

- Added 3 volumes of gel weight (5th column in table)of ADB to each sample tube (kit buffer)
- Incubated sample tubes at 50 degrees C in the heat block for 10 minutes (they seemed completely dissolved after this)
- After this, the heat block was bumped to 70 degrees and elution buffer was incubated until later
- Clipped tips of pipettes and added the total volume of each dissolved gel tube to individual spin columns and collection tubes provided by the kit
- Centrifuged spin columns for 1 minute at 12,000rcf
- Pipetted out flow through
- Added 200ul of DNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged columns for 30 seconds at 12,000rcf
- Pipetted out flow through
- Added another 200ul DNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged for 30 seconds at 12,000rcf
- Pipetted out flow through
- Centrifuged for 1 minute at 12,000rcf "dry"
- Transferred columns to final 1.5mL tubes
- Added 15ul of 70 degree C DNA elution buffer directly to the filters in the columns
- Incubated the columns on the bench for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged the columns for 30 seconds at 12,000rcf
- Added 15ul of 70 degree C DNA elution buffer directly to the filters in the columns
- Incubated the columns on the bench for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged the columns for 30 seconds at 12,000rcf
- Put the tubes on ice for Qubiting
- Qubit HS DNA Assay:
  - 3mLB-150: 8.32ng/ul
  - 3mLB-UP: 2.99ng/ul
  - 3mLB-LOW: 4.15ng/ul
