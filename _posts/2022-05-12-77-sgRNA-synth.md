title: 77kb sgRNA Synthesis and Purification
---

## Synthesis of sgRNAs 86 and 92 for the 77kb DiNV Region Using the [EnGenÂ® sgRNA Synthesis Kit, _S. pyogenes_](https://www.neb.com/products/e3322-engen-sgrna-synthesis-kit-s-pyogenes#Product%20Information) and Purification with the [Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/rna-clean-concentrator-kits-rcc/products/rna-clean-concentrator-25)

**Prep**
- p2 and p20-200 tips were autoclaved, and filter p1000 tips were acquired
- The whole bench was wiped down with 70% ethanol and then RNase Away, as well as the tip boxes, pipettes, racks, and gloves
- Thawed kit components on ice, as well as the guide RNA primers (designed [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/02/16/sgRNA-2-sites.html)) that have been diluted to 1uM
- Set the heat block to 37 degrees C

**sgRNA Synthesis Kit**
- Flicked to mix tubes and spun them all down
- Assembled **separate** reactions in 1.5mL tubes **on the bench,** not on ice
- Each reaction contained (in order):
  - 2ul molecular grade water
  - 10ul 2X sgRNA reaction mix
  - 1ul of 1uM primer, either for 86 or 92
  - 1ul 0.1M DTT
  - 2ul sgRNA enzyme mix
- Tubes were pipette mixed with 10ul
- Tubes were spun down
- Placed tubes in the heat block at 37 for 30 minutes
- Afterwards, transferred the tubes to ice
- Added 30ul molecular grade water to each tube
- Added 2ul of DNaseI and pipette mixed
- Spun down tubes
- Incubated tubes in the heat block at 37 for 15 minutes

**RNA Clean and Concentrator Kit**
- Took tubes out of the heat block and let come to room temp
- Made sure RNA wash buffer had ethanol added (it had)
- Added 2X the volume of sample (104ul) of RNA binding buffer to each tube
- Pipette mixed
- Added 1.5X the volume (231ul) 100% ethanol to each tube (the kit says to do 1.5X for RNA expected to be between 17-200nt in size, the NEB kit says they should be ~100nt)
- Pipette mixed
- Transferred liquid from each tube into their own spin column
- Centrifuged columns at 15,800rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through
- Added 400ul RNA prep buffer to each column
- Centrifuged columns at 15,800rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through
- Added 700ul RNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged columns at 15,800rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through
- Added 400ul RNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged columns at 15,800rcf for 1 minute
- Discarded flow through
- Centrifuged columns "dry" at 15,800rcf for 30 seconds
- Transferred columns to final 1.5mL tubes
- Added 40ul nuclease free water to each column and let sit for ~1 minute
- Centrifuged columns at 15,800rcf for 30 seconds
- Placed tubes on ice

**Quantification**
- Used Qubit HS RNA kit
- Made mix:
  - 895ul buffer
  - 4.5ul reagent
- 190ul mix to standard tubes
- 199ul mix to sample tubes
- 10ul of standards to standard tubes
- 1ul RNA to sample tubes
- Vortex, spin down, and incubate in dark for 2 minutes before reading:
  - sgRNA 86: 66.9ng/ul
  - sgRNA 92: 17.4ng/ul
- Total yeild in 39ul is:
  - 86: 39*66.9 = 2.6ug
  - 92: 39*17.4 = 678.6ng
- Used [online calculator](https://www.bioline.com/media/calculator/01_07.html) to calculate the concentration in nM of each sgRNA. Used 100nt as the size (0.1kb)
  - 86: 1960nM
  - 92: 511.01nM

I need to make a 300nM solution for the digestion test, so this seems like it is a good amount. I am a little worried about my yield. The synthesis kit said it should produce 4-50ug of guide RNA. I am wondering if I should have used warmed water and a longer incubation time when eluting the RNA from the cleanup kit.
