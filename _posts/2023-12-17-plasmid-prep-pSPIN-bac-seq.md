title: Preparing pSPIN-BAC for Sequencing

## Plasmid Mini-prep and Preparation for Sequencing of pSPIN-BAC 

We want to sequence the pSPIN-BAC just to make sure that it is the same plasmid that Genewiz sent us and their sequence they sent was correct. 

Based off of the [previous work](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/12/15/pSPIN-BAC-glycerol-and-antibiotic-check.html) that showed that colony 3 bacteria is not resistant to Chloramphenicol, I decided to use a colony from the chlor+kan plate from colony 1 to grow up for sequencing. 

**20231217 growing overnight cultures**

- Prepared 3 tubes of LB with both antibiotics:
    - 0.9ul of stock Kanamycin 
    - 0.55ul of stock Chloramphenicol 
    - These are based off of the tubes of LB being slightly less than 2mL and previous volumes used 
- From the chlor+kab plate of the colony 1 stock, a colony was picked and placed into each tube with a tip 
- The tubes were placed in the 37C shaker overnight to grow 

**20231218 Plasmid Prep**

- Using the Qiagen Qiaprep Miniprep for quick plasmid extraction, these will just be for sequencing and don't need a lot or endotoxin free 
- Placed an aliquot of elution buffer in the heat block at 70C
- All 3 culture tubes had grown nicely
- Harvested 4mL of culture, 1mL into each of 4 1.5mL tubes
- Centrifuged the tubes for 3 minutes at 6,000g
- Removed the supernatant from each tube into the bacteria waste
- Resuspended the pellets in 250ul of cold buffer PI (stored in 4C) until there were no more cell clumps 
- Added 250ul of buffer P2 and inverted to mix, solution became sort of viscous 
- Added 350ul of buffer N3 and mixed immediately 1 tube at a time by inverting
    - Visible precipitate was seen 
- Centrifuged at 16,300rcf for 10 minutes at room temp 
    - this is to pellet the debris, SDS, and chromosomal DNA
- Added the ~800ul of supernatant to the spin columns provided by the kit
- Centrifuged the columns 60 seconds at 16,300rcf 
- Discarded the flow through 
- Added 500ul of buffer PB to the columns
- Centrifuged the columns 60 seconds at 16,300rcf 
- Discarded the flow through
- Added 750ul of buffer PE to the columns
- Centrifuged the columns 60 seconds at 16,300rcf 
- Discarded the flow through 
- Centrifuged the columns 60 seconds at 16,300rcf "dry"
- Placed spin columns in final 1.5mL tubes labeled 
- Added 30ul of warmed buffer EB and let sit on the filter for 1 minute
- Centrifuged the columns 60 seconds at 16,300rcf
- Placed tubes with DNA on ice and quantification 
- Quantified the DNA with the Qubit using the standard [Qubit protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCz0SBof6LHE3P_LbftawFyexl8iCECUlvjIcauPYwY/edit)
    - 1: 36.3ng/ul
    - 2: 47.1ng/ul
    - 3: 43ng/ul
    - 4: 27.9ng/ul 
- For Plasmidsaurus they want at least 10ul with a concentration of 30ng/ul 
- I decided to use tube 2 because it had the most DNA 
- I wanted to send 20ul, at 30ng/ul that is a total of 600ng to send
- 600/47.5 = 12.6ul of tube 2 and 7.4ul of buffer EB to dilute the DNA 
- This was put in a strip tube, wrapped in parafilm, and placed in a 50mL conical 
- The strip tube had the code for sequencing A4W on it 
- Because of the holidays, the sample was not sent out for sequencing until Jan 2nd, and was in the -20 until then
- Sequencing showed that the consensus sequence from Plasmidsaurus was an exact match to the sequence sent from Genewiz, plasmid is intact and ready to use
