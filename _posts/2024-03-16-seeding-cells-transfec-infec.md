title: Adding Dv-1 and Myd88 Cells to Transfection Plate and Infection Plate
---

## Adding Dv-1 and Myd88 Cells to the [12 Well Plate for Transfection with GFP Plasmid](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/12/dinn-transfect-plate.html), and Making 24 Well Plates for Myd88 Infection Assay 

I was both adding cells to the plate that already had Dinn-1 cells for transfection with the GFP plasmid, as well as making plates for an infection test for the Myd88 cells. 1 12 well plate used for transfection. 2 24 well plates used for infection (a day 0 and a day 5). 

**Myd88 Cells**
- Passage 44 cells 
- Scrapped and pelleted, the cells were resuspended in 5mL of fresh medium 
- 20ul was counted in a hemocytometer:
    - Q1: 529
    - Q2: 555
    - Q3: 590
    - Q4: 482
    - Average: 539 
- Cells per mL = 5,390,000 cells 
- For the 12 well transfection plate:
    - 6mL of medium was needed 
    - 150ul of cell solution was added
    - 1.5mL of solution was added to column 2 in the plate 
    - This is ~200,000 cells added per well 
- For the 24 well infection plates: 
    - 16mL of medium was needed 
    - 600ul of cell solution was added 
    - 1mL of solution was added to column 2 and column 5 in both plates (one for day 0 and one for day 5)
    - This is ~200,000 cells added per well

**Dv-1 Cells**
- Passage 83 cells 
- Scrapped and pelleted, the cells were resuspended in 11mL of fresh medium 
- 20ul was counted in a hemocytometer:
    - Q1: 430
    - Q2: 438
    - Q3: 364
    - Q4: 409
    - Average: 410
- Cells per mL = 4,102,500 cells 
- For the 12 well transfection plate:
    - 6mL of medium was needed 
    - 100ul of cell solution was added
    - 1.5mL of solution was added to column 1 in the plate 
    - This is ~100,000 cells added per well 
- For the 24 well infection plates: 
    - 16mL of medium was needed 
    - 400ul of cell solution was added 
    - 1mL of solution was added to column 2 and column 5 in both plates (one for day 0 and one for day 5)
    - This is ~100,000 cells added per well
