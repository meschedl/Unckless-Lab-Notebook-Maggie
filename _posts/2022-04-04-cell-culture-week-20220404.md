## Primary Cell Culture Generation and Cell Culture Maintenance Week of 20220404

**20220404**
- Generated primary cells from myd88 and D. innubila using the [updated primary cell culture protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/03/31/updated-cell-culture-protocol.html)
  - Made 1 flask of D. innubila (very few eggs, only 1/4 plates had more than ~4 eggs on it)
  - Made 3 flasks of myd88: 1 top and 2 bottom
- Made fresh 20% FBS medium using the 75%:25% old to new FBS
- Using the 75:25 medium, did a 3mL fluid change on:
  - 2 flasks from 02/24 innubila
  - 2 flasks from 02/23 innubila
  - 1 flask from 01/13 innubila
- I had to add some 20% new FBS medium to the 75:25 tube because I did not have enough to do the secondary transfer for the 01/27 flask. These cells might not do as well because of it
- Trypsinized and cell scrapped the 01/27 flask and separated it into 2 new flasks because there was a large build up of precipitate in the flask
  - Poured off medium from flask
  - Added 3mL room temp trypsin and distributed
  - Poured off trypsin
  - Added another 3mL trypsin and distributed
  - Let flask sit for 2 minutes
  - Added 5mL 20% FBS medium
  - Pipetted a few times to get the cells off the side of the flask
  - I noticed they weren't really coming off, so I used a cell scrapper on them as well to removed the stuck cells
  - Transferred the liquid to a 10mL glass tube
  - Centrifuged tube for 5 minutes at 200rpm
  - Aspirated out the supernatant
  - Resuspended the pellet in 5mL 20% FBS medium
  - Made a new flask with 5mL 20% FBS medium
  - Added the liquid from the tube to the 5mL flask and pipette mixed
  - Separated that flask out into 2, so there were two flasks with 5mL each in them

  - Generated primary cells from myd88 and D. innubila using the [updated primary cell culture protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/03/31/updated-cell-culture-protocol.html)
    - Made 2 flasks of innubila cells, 1 top and 1 bottom 
    - Made 3 flasks of myd88: 1 top and 2 bottom
