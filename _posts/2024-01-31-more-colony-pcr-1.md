title: Colony PCR on Electroporation Plate
---

## More Colony PCR on Plates from Electroporation of pSPIN-BAC E. coli with DiNV DNA Attempt 1

I decided to pick at least 10 more colonies of each of the plates [prepared after electroporation](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/01/29/electro-DiNV-DNA-1.html) and do colony PCR on them. The [first set](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/01/30/colony-pcr-electro-DiNV.html) did not show much promise of DiNV. I used [this Addgene blog for help on how to plan the PCRs](https://blog.addgene.org/plasmids-101-colony-pcr). Rob suggested doing a positive control PCR and using 16S (bacterial) to see if the colony PCR works at all. I did not pick any colonies from the negative control plates for this time. 

For each colony, I picked it with an autoclaved pipette tip and swirled it in the tube of 5ul of water for a few seconds:

- Thawed reagents and primers on ice, vortexed and spun down
- Prepared master mixes on ice:

|reagent|16S volume|p47 volume|
|---|---|---|
|GoTaq|450ul|450ul|
|Forward primer|22.5ul|22.5ul|
|Reverse primer|22.5ul|22.5ul|
|molecular grade water|315ul|315ul|

- Vortexed and spun down master mixes
- Aliquoited 9ul of master mix to strip tubes 
- Added 1ul of colony-water mix to each tube
- Added 1ul of molecular grade water, and 1ul of positive DNA for the p47 primers to their respective tubes 
- Vortexed and spun down 
- Placed tubes in the p47 and 16S PCR programs, the p47 program cycling 35 times, the 16S program only 30

Initially I only ran the p47 results on a gel because I expected the 16S to run with no issue. Because of gel staining issues I had to run these samples across 3 separate gels:

For the third gel the samples to look at are 100-107 and the controls only:

A couple samples looked potentially promising...
