## qPCR of Myd88 and Dv-1 Cells Infected with DiNV to Check for DiNV Growth 

Samples were DNA extracted [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/23/myd88-infec-dna.html). All samples are run in triplicate. 

All samples were flick mixed and spun down before use in qPCR. Using Lambda DNA as the control.

qPCR mixes:

|reagent|LAMBDA|PIF 3|
|---|---|---|
|Sso|505ul	|505ul|
|F primer|50.5ul|50.5ul|
|R primer|50.5ul|50.5ul|
|molec grade water|	208ul|208ul|

9ul of reagent mix was added to each well in the plate as planned (see layout below). 1ul of DNA was added to each well as planned, and samples were run in triplicate. After addition of DNA each sample well was pipette mixed 10 times, then the plate was sealed and spun down.

The plates was run on the p47 program in the KMM folder.

The same layout was used for each primer, one plate for PIF 3 and one plate for LAMBDA:
