## Planning for Cloning DiNV With pSPIN By Designing BAC and pSPIN

**Begin with checking [pSPIN/pSL1142](https://www.addgene.org/160730/) for the restriction sites where the donor DNA/BAC can be inserted**
- This is all done in Geneious where I have a good annotated file of the plasmid 
- The left side of the insert site has a Xho1 restriction site
- The left side of the insert site has a Pst1 restriction site 
- We can't go any further into the plasmid because we need to keep the VchINT sites for the integration to happen (sites needed for transposition)

**Checking our two BACs for those restriction sites** 
- Both pBeloBAC11 and pBACe3.6 have a Xho1 restriction site near their ORI2
- Neither have a Pst1 restriction site 
- I'm not sure at this point if we need both restriction sites or not to clone in the BAC
- In general, pBACe3.6 has less restriction sites than pBeloBAC11 

**Comparing BACs**
- pBeloBAC11 has Chloramphenicol resistance 
- pBACe3.6 has both Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin resistance 
- pBAC3e3.6 is 11,612bp
- pBeloBAC11 is 7,507bp
- Maybe it is better to start with a smaller BAC because we will have to add in things to it? if pAc5 promoter ends up working, that is ~2,500bp not including the fluorescence gene 


**What are things needed in the BAC?**
- Resistance/selectable marker
    - We have this in either BAC
- Fluorescence marker 
    - Low priority if next weeks transfection results are inconclusive/negative 
- Recombinase sites 
    - This I am unsure how to design/place
- Site for cloning into pSPIN

**Where to put in the recombinase and potential Fluorescence marker in the BAC**

- If we are stuck with the Xhol1 as the cloning site, then I'm not sure how we can get the recombinase sites and marker in

- Restriction sites highlighted pBACe3.6:

- However, maybe we can have genewix clone into the BAC the marker, recombinase sites, as well as the sites for cloning into pSPIN, so it all fits? 


**What does the pSPIN need?**
- Selectable marker
    - Has Kanamycin resistance 
- Designed BAC inserted 
- crRNA sequence inserted 

**Revisiting the crRNA sequences**

Reminder that efficiency score comes from [this website](https://www.flyrnai.org/evaluateCrispr/input) and can only take 20bp of sequence. Everything else comes from BLASTing the sequence to various species databases.

Based off of this, we are most interested in in # 0, 7, and maybe 2 and 3. Where are these crRNA sites in DiNV?

Ok and how do these crRNA sites line up to primers I already have used in this region of DiNV?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/crRNA-DiNV-primer.png)

The primers I already have may work, it is hard to imagine what this area will look like once the BAC is inserted into it. The goal would be to have primers that start on the DiNV side, and go into the BAC. 

Here I have where I think the actual insertion sites might be. I put them 49bp downstream of the crRNA sequence... I am not sure if that is doing the proper orientation.
