title: HMW Extraction Attempt 5
---

## 3mL Input into the Genomic Tip [Blood & Cell Culture DNA Midi Kit](https://www.qiagen.com/sg/shop/pcr/blood-and-cell-culture-dna-midi-kit/) HMW Extraction Kit on a 0hr and at 120hr DiNV Infected Dv-1 Cells from Kent


**Notes**
- Sample Info: Kent inoculated Dv-1 cells for me last week, and froze the flask after 5 days/120 hours (should have a lot of virus at this timepoint). He also froze a flask at hour 0 that I can use as a control/extraction control/cell control/something (I'm not sure what). Unfortunately the flasks were frozen, but ideally I would have liked to have taken the cells fresh, used a cell scraper to get the cells off the bottom of the flasks, then aliquot them into single use tubes. I did that anyways, just with froze-thawed cells. I set aside 3mL for a mega extraction attempt in 15mL tubes that I kept in the fridge overnight for use the next day. The remaining 5mL I split up into 5 1.5mL tubes and stored them in the -80. For all pipetting I used a cut pipette tip.
- Samples for this extraction:
  - 120hr: Dv-1 120hr inc-11-2-21 frozen 11-7-21
  - 0hr: Dv-1 0hr inc-11-2-21 frozen 11-2-21
- Let the pellet dry for at least 30 min
- Going to leave the samples resuspending for over 24 hours
- I went back to the swing bucket rotor that does 4816g because I haven't done a full extraction at that speed, and because I couldn't find Paul in the Slusky lab to ask where the fixed angle rotor was. At least this time the pellet will be at the bottom of the tube

**Sample Washing**

- Placed 1X PBS and molec grade water on ice
- Kept samples on ice
  - I noticed just how much more "stuff" there was in the 120hr sample (120hr on the left). I'm guessing this is because these cells had 5 more days to grow than the 0hr did

- Set centrifuge on the 5th floor to go to 4 degrees
- Added 7mL cold PBS to each tube with 3mL sample
- Centrifuged tubes at 1,500rcf for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C
- Removed supernatant from each tube without disturbing the pellet
  - There was a muchlarger pellet for the 120hr

  - Than for the 120hr
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/20211109-hmw-3.jpeg)
- Added 10mL cold PBS to each tube
- Centrifuged tubes at 1,500rcf for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C
- Removed supernatant
- Added 2mL cold PBS to each tube
- Added 2mL cold buffer C1 to each tube
- Added 6mL cold molecular grade water to each tube
- Vortexed to get the pellet to resuspend
- Let tubes sit on ice for 10 minutes
- Centrifuged 1,300rcf for 15 minutes at 4 degrees C
- Removed supernatant without disturbing the pellet
  - There was a small pellet in each sample
- Added 1mL cold buffer C1 to each tube
- Added 3mL cold molecular grade water to each tube
- Vortexed breifly
- Centrifuged 1,300rcf for 15 minutes at 4 degrees C
- Removed supernatant

**Incubation**
- Added 5mL buffer G2 to each tube
- Added 95mL proteinase K to each tube
- Vortexed tubes briefly
  - I had to vortex these a lot, especially the 120hr because the pellet wouldn't break up
- Placed tubes in the incubator at 50 degrees C for ~60 minutes

**Genomic Tip Extraction**
- Set up two tips over 50mL conicals
- Added 4mL buffer GBT to each tip and let drip
  - Drip times were pretty consistent between the tips, the POS-2 sample tip was a little slower, but not by much. Max drip time was ~10 min which is great
- Vortexed sample tubes briefly
- Cut p1000 tips for each samples
- Added total volume (~5mL) of each sample to their respective tips and let drip
- Placed buffer QF in the incubator to warm to 50 degrees C
- Added 7.5mL of buffer QC to each tip
- Transferred tips to a new 15mL waste conical
- Added 7.5mL of buffer QC to each tip
- Transferred tips to new 15mL conicals labeled for final tubes
- Added 5mL of warmed buffer QF to each tip and let drip

**Precipitation**
- Added 4mL of 100% isopropanol to each elutent tube and inverted multiple times to mix (it looked like there was ~5.8mL of volume)
- Centrifuged tubes in the Slusky Lab at 4 degrees C 4,816rcf for 40 min (I increased the time here to hopefully get more DNA to precipitate)
- Afterwards it was very hard to see a pellet
  - I thought I saw one in the 120hr sample, although it's the bottom of the tube which can play tricks on your eyes. I was less sure about there being a pellet in the 0hr sample

- Put the tubes back on ice and brought to 4055
- Removed the supernatant from each tube, pipetting from the side of the tube without the white patch to avoid any pellet
- Added 2mL cold 70% ethanol to each tube
- Vortexed tubes briefly
- Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 8,816 rcf at 4 degrees C in the same centrifuge
- Tubes were transferred on ice again
- Removed the supernatant from each tube, pipetting from the side of the tube without the white patch to avoid any pellet
- Flipped the tubes upside-down on a kim wipe and let them sit for ~45 minutes to dry
- Added 50ul of 1X TE to each tube
- Tubes were placed in the incubator upright at 55 degrees C
  - **This incubation was supposed to be for 1 hour, but I forgot about them and only remembered after 3 hours (I came back into the lab at ~7pm). I just put the tubes on the bench for the rest of the night**

- Tubes were gently flicked, spun down, and placed on a rocking stand for another 24 hrs
