title: Another Hirt DNA Extraction a DiNV DNA
---

## Using the Hirt Method To Extract DiNV DNA for Later Comparison with Puregene Extraction  

Using samples 36, 37, 38, and 39 that were already cell pellets frozen at -80, find info [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19HplN9TvH7pDqtDkWpclmwUZHeBB1PwhQunieT6FHSo/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

**Lysis and Chromosomal DNA Precipitation**

- The small centrifuge was placed in the 4C at least an hour before use
- All processes were done in the fume hood
- Added 100ul 50mM Tris HCl, 10mM EDTA to all the samples
- Added 4ul of 4mg/mL RNase A to each sample
- Added 150ul of 1.2% SDS to each tube
- Inverted tubes, gently resuspended pellet with clipped pipette tips to mix 
- Incubated tubes on bench for ~20 minutes to lyse/digest all cells/virus
    - This seemed to work, periodically inverted the samples throughout that time
- Precipitated chromosomal DNA and cellular debris by added 210ul of 3M CsCl, 1M potassium acetate, 0.67M acetic acid
  - A white precipitate immediately started forming in the tubes, I pipette mixed the solution with clipped pipette tips
- Immediately placed tubes on ice for 30 minutes incubation 
- Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000rcf at 4 degrees C (I did not do a second centrifuge because it always seemed unnecessary)
- During this time I made fresh 80% and 100% ethanol and put them in the -20 freezer to cool
- Moved supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes 
    - 36: 475ul
    - 37: 485ul
    - 38: 457ul
    - 39: 485ul


**Phenol Chloroform Extraction**

- Still in the fume hood
- Added equal volume of cold phenol-chloroform-isoamy-alcohol to the tubes (Note!! phenol-chloroform-isoamy-alcohol is in two phases, I think you are supposed to use the bottom layer for this, see [x](https://hermanlab.unl.edu/protocols/phenolppt.html))
    - 36: 475ul
    - 37: 485ul
    - 38: 457ul
    - 39: 485ul
- Mixed tubes up and down and then put them on an orbital mixer in the hood for 10 minutes, the samples did become cloudy at this time
- Centrifuged tubes at 16,000rcf at room temp for 15 minutes
- Looked for phase separation
  - Phase separation looked great, there were two distinct layers in each tube, there was a small white layer between the two phases
- Transferred top aqueous phase to new final labeled tubes (did not use clipped tips here for better pipetting )
    - 36: 440ul
    - 37: 430ul
    - 38: 400ul
    - 39: 427ul
- Added 0.1X tube liquid volume of new 3M NaOAc to each tube
    - 36: 44ul
    - 37: 43ul
    - 38: 40ul
    - 39: 42.7ul
- Added 1000ul of cold 100% ethanol to each tube
- Inverted tubes to mix
- Placed tubes in the -20 overnight

**20240303 DNA Precipitation**

- Took tubes out of the freezer and centrifuged tubes at max speed at 4C for 30 minutes
  - Tubes had not frozen in the freezer
  - Each tube looked like they had a pellet that was pretty visible
- Pipetted off supernatant into a waste container
- Added 500ul of cold fresh 80% ethanol and inverted twice to mix
- Centrifuged tubes at max speed at 4C for 30 minutes
- Pipetted off supernatant into a waste container
- Let tubes dry ~30 minutes upside-down on the bench
- Resuspended pellets in 20ul of 10mM tris HCl and left on the bench a few hours before qubiting 
- Qubit followed [this protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCz0SBof6LHE3P_LbftawFyexl8iCECUlvjIcauPYwY/edit) for broad range reagents
