title: Testing DiNV Infection on Myd88 Cells

## Using Fluid From Primary D. innubila Cells Infected with DiNV to Test Infection on Myd88 cells 

Experimental Plan:  
I want to use the aliquots of DiNV containing fluid from infected _D. innubila_ cells as a test liquid on the Myd88 cells I have, they are on passage 20. But I have a limited supply of the fluid, so I have to be careful about the design. My idea is to use Dv-1 cells as a control because I don't know how this fluid causes infection in Dv-1 cells, it hasn't been used on them. I also know I have to take day 0 flasks for samples of base level of virus just after adding it.  
Flasks needed:   
3 Myd88 flasks, 1 for day 0 and 2 for day 5   
3 Dv-1 flasks, 1 for day 0 and 2 for day 5   
I want to sample the flasks after 5 days because that is when the replication of DiNV is the most in Dv-1 cells. I will want to take supernatant and cell fractions of the flasks for qPCR analysis. 

**20230106 Plating Cells**

- First I need to plate the cells into the flasks I need, and I want to try to do it in a quantified way. The main issue is that the Myd88 cells do not replicate as fast as the Dv-1 cells do
- I decided to make 4 flasks of each line 
- I read on [this website](https://www.allevi3d.com/passaging-cells-protocol/) that I should plate 2,000-5,000 cells per cm^2 (this might have been too many but we'll see) which comes out to 50,000-100,000 cells per 25cm^2 flask (this may have been fine, [this other resource](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/cell-culture-protocols/cell-culture-useful-numbers.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAqt-dBhBcEiwATw-ggG62kMWDNDS8C1f-BareWu6obH3BrkA6NVbzc_XvO43SnRpGB9t9KhoCWVUQAvD_BwE&ef_id=CjwKCAiAqt-dBhBcEiwATw-ggG62kMWDNDS8C1f-BareWu6obH3BrkA6NVbzc_XvO43SnRpGB9t9KhoCWVUQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3652!3!530416915615!!!g!!!382790548!125487008778&cid=bid_clb_cce_r01_co_cp0000_pjt0000_bid00000_0se_gaw_dy_pur_con&s_kwcid=AL!3652!3!530416915615!!!g!!) suggests using 700,000 per flask)
- I decided to try 50,000 cells for the Dv-1 cells and 75,000 cells for the Myd88 cells per flask 
- I scraped up Myd88 cells and counted them with a hemocytometer 

|section|quadrant 1|quadrant 2| quadrant 3| quadrant 4|section average|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|242|221|227|211|225|
|2|272|281|203|223|245|
- Each section was averaged, and the average of the two sections was taken
  - Total Myd88 average: 235
- The cells per mL is the average * 10^4
  - 235 * 10^4 = 2,350,000 cells per mL 
- If I want 75,000 cells per flask, then I want 300,000 cells total (4 flasks)
- (2,350,000 cells)(5mL) = (300,000 cells)(xmL)
    - x = 40mL 
- I then divided these by 3 to get the amount of cells in ~20mL (the amount needed to make 4 flasks) and so I used 2mL of cells and 20mL of medium to dilute the cells 
- Dv-1 cells were also counted with the hemocytometer 

|section|quadrant 1|quadrant 2| quadrant 3| quadrant 4|section average|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|216|239|341|299|274|
|2|305|328||345|295|
- Each section was averaged, and the average of the two sections was taken
  - Total Dv-1 average: 296
- The cells per mL is the average * 10^4
  - 296 * 10^4 = 2,960,000 cells per mL 
- If I want 50,000 cells per flask, then I want 200,000 cells total (4 flasks)
- (2,960,000 cells)(5mL) = (200,000 cells)(xmL)
    - x = 74mL 
- I then divided these by 4 to get the amount of cells in ~20mL (the amount needed to make 4 flasks) and so I used 1.2mL of cells and 20mL of medium to dilute the cells 
- Flasks were placed in the 22C incubator to grow over the weekend

**20230109 Infecting Cells**
- Thawed 6 day 26 innubila primary fluid infected with DiNV on ice (later I noticed that one of these had less than 40ul, so I thawed a 7th one in my hands)
- Spun down aliquots 
- Got 5mL tubes for the day 0 supernatant freezings 
- Added 40ul DiNV fluid to each of 6 flasks made on Friday (see above). 3 were Dv-1 and 3 were Myd88 
- For 1 Myd88 and 1 Dv-1 flask I aspirated the supernatant after adding the virus and put it in a 5mL tube
- I then took the 5mL tube and the flask it came from and placed them in the -80
- These were labeled "day 0" for initial samples 
- The others were rocked back and forth gently after virus addition, then laid horizontal 
- I ethanol sprayed two old p1000 pipette tip boxes and used them as boxes for the infected flasks to keep them separate in the incubator 
- Put the flasks in the 22 degree incubator until Saturday where I will harvest them 
- Sprayed everything with ethanol after this to make sure any virus residue had been eliminated 

**20230114 Freezing Cells**
- Started up cell culture hood
- I had 6 flasks to separate and freeze: 2 infected flasks per cell type and 1 non-infected flask per cell type 
- For every flask I removed ~5mL of supernatant from the flasks and placed in a 5mL sterile tube, these were labeled A and B for the replicates so I could tell which flask they came from  
- The flasks were also labeled
- All flasks and 5mL tubes of supernatant were frozen at -80 C
