All flasks kept had 2mL of 10% FBS Schneider's medium added to them. 

**D. innubila Primaries**

10/04 3 flasks rescued from plates 
- Mixed bag, some places where cells look alive, some not 
- Not any areas where cells are growing out
- Maybe they suffered from being scraped up, keep anyways 

10/05 3 flasks rescued from plates 
- Some clumps are alive but aren't settling to the flask surface
- No growth out but pretty much all cells look alive so worth keeping 

12/14 2 flasks 
- Not a lot of cells 
- Some good clumps of cells that look alive and have settled, but no growth out 
- Also a lot of dead looking cells 
- Still fluid addition 

12/13 2 flasks 
- I found 1 clump of cells contracting!
- Many clumps of alive cells, but no growth out yet 
- Fluid addition 

8/11 2 flasks 
- Not a lot of cells 
- Some cells look dead but there are some clumps that look alive, it is probably worth keeping and adding fluid 

9/20 2 flasks
- Lots of alive clumps of cells, just they are all floating 
- Fluid addition 

8/21 2 flasks and 8/23 1 flask
- Basically no alive cells - thrown out 

8/18 1 flask 
- Not a lot of cells 
- Some cells look dead but there are some clumps that look alive, it is probably worth keeping and adding fluid

8/31 and 8/30 flasks 
- Very few areas of growing out cells
- A lot of cells that look dead 
- Fluid addition anyways to keep 

9/21 1 flask 
- Not a lot of good looking cells but some
- A lot of cells that look dead 
- Fluid addition anyways to keep 

05/02 2 flasks 
- Some crystals are forming in these 
- Some areas of growing cells, the flasks are just a little sparce, not a lot of cells in general
- Fuild addition

9/27 2 flasks 
- Lots of alive clumps of cells, most are floating 
- Some areas of growing cells 
- Fluid addition

9/13 supernatant 1 flask 
- The best looking flask 
- Lots of areas of growing cells 
- Fluid addition again and think about scraping up and replating soon

**IMD null**

07/27 4 flasks 
- Lots of a live cells, lots of the dark clumps of stringy like cells 
- Looking good, just that it doesn't seem to have grown any since I looked at them 2 weeks ago
