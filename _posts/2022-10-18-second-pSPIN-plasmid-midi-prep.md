title: Addgene Plasmid pSL1142, New Glycerol Stocks and Plasmid Midiprep
---

## Second Attempt At Creating Glycerol Stocks from [pSL1142](https://www.addgene.org/160730/) from Addgene, and Doing a Plasmid Midiprep to Extract Plasmid DNA

I received some information from Addgene on what Kanamycin concentration to use to keep the plasmid in the bacteria. They suggested using 50ug/mL for all culturing.

**20221018 Plating Agar Stabs**
- Warmed 2 LB plates on the bench
- Sterilized the bench space and the loop before use
- Labeled 2 plates with the plasmid information
- Diluted the 100mg/mL Kanamycin stock:
  - Want 50ug/mL in 20mL (plate volume)
  - (100,000mg/mL)(x) = 50mL * 20mL
    - x = 0.01mL or 10ul
  - Dilute 20ul Kanamycin in 40ul of water
- Pipetted 30ul of diluted Kanamycin on each plate and spread with a sterile spreader
- Waited ~3 minutes for it to soak in
- Dipped the loop in the agar stab and spread on an LB plate
- Sterilized the loop between each plate
- Plates were placed upside down in the 37C incubator overnight, then put in the fridge the next day

**20221020 Overnight Cultures**
- In the afternoon, the best plate with visible individual colonies was used to grow overnight cultures
- Labeled 3 LB tubes
- Sterilized the bench space and used the flame
- Diluted Kanamycin:
  - Want 50ug/mL in 2mL
  - (100,000mg/mL)(x) = 50mL * 2mL
    - x = 0.001mL or 1ul
- Added 1ul of Kanamycin stock to each LB tube
- Picked 1 colony from the plate with a pipette tip and dropped it in the test tube
- Placed the tubes in the 37C incubator shaking overnight

**20221021 Making Glycerol Stocks**
- Sterilized the bench space and used the flame
- Made up 2 cryotubes for making stocks
- Going to replace the old glycerol stocks I had made that don't actually have the plasmid
  - 137: pSL1142 pSPIN
- Added 750ul of 50% glycerol to each cryotube
- Added 750ul of culture to the tubes and pipette mixed
- Bleached the test tubes when done
- Tubes went into the bacterial stocks and the back up stocks boxes in the -80

**20221025 Plating from Glycerol Stocks**
- Labeled 1 LB plate
- Added a diluted Kanamycin to the plate (10ul stock + 20ul water, as above) and spread with a sterile spreader
- Sterilized loop
- Dipped the loop in the stock and spread it on the plate
- Plate was put upside down in the 37C incubator and taken out and put into the fridge the next morning

**20221026 Making Overnight Cultures from Stock Grown Plates**
- Want to make 150mL of culture for pSL1142
- Made 250mL of LB broth:
  - 5g LB
  - 250mL DI H20
  - Shake to mix
- Aliquoted 150mL into 1 500mL flask
- Used the rest for test tubes
- Foiled the flasks and autoclaved them on cycle 3
- Put them in the fridge when done
- Took them out before use to warm up a little
- Calculated Kanamycin needed:
  - (100,000ug/mL)(x) = 50ug/mL * 150mL
    - x = 0.075mL or 75ul
- Added 75ul of Kanamycin stock to the liquid LB and swirled it around
- Picked 1 colony from the 10/25 plate and dropped it into the flask
- Placed the flask in the 37 degree shaking incubator overnight

**20220908 Midiprep Extraction**
- Started at ~12:20pm
- Took flask out of the incubator and used serological pipettes to transfer the liquid cultures into 50mL conicals
- Took these tubes to the Egan lab and fast cooled their centrifuge. Then ran it at 6,000rcf at 4C for 20 minutes
- While the centrifuge was running:
  - Got an ice bucket and chilled buffer P3
  - Prepared buffer P1: 12mL of P1 (mix before pipetting) and 24ul of 100mg/mL of RNase A and kept on ice
- Got tubes from the Egan lab and poured off the supernatant
  - There was a large bacterial pellet in all tubes
- Added 4mL of buffer P1 and vortexed until the cell pellet was resuspended
- Added 4mL of buffer P2 to each tube
  - Tubes should be gently mixed until all liquid becomes blue and viscous
- Incubated tubes at room temp on the bench for 5 minutes
- Added 4mL cold buffer P3 to each tube
  - Inverted tubes to mix until the liquid was white and not viscous
- Incubated tubes on ice for 15 minutes
- Took tubes to the Egan lab an centrifuged 4C at 12,400rcf for 40 minutes
- Brought up new 15mL tubes to the Egan lab
- By the centrifuge, transferred the supernatant to the new 15mL tubes
- Centrifuged the 15mL tubes for 30 min at 4C 12,400rcf
- Put the small centrifuge in the fridge to cool down
- Turned on the incubator to 65C and warmed buffer QF
- Prepared a new conical of 100% isopropanol and 70% ethanol
- Set up a genomic tips over a 50mL conical for waste liquid
- Added 4mL buffer QBT to the tip and let drip through
- Brought tubes downstairs from Egan lab (turned off their centrifuge)
- Transferred supernatant to the tip and let drip through, repeating for each tube, all liquid going into the same tip. I let the liquid completely drip out before adding in more
- Transferred waste conical when needed
- Added 10mL of buffer QC to the tip and let drip through
- Added another 10mL buffer QC and let drip through
- Transferred the tip to a new 15mL tube
- Added 5mL of warm buffer QF to the tip and let drip through
- Prepared 7 1.5mL tubes and labeled as final tubes
- Took the eluted liquid from the 15mL conical and spread it out over the 7 1.5mL tubes
  - For the first 6 tubes they would get 833ul elutent each
  - The 7th tube got a different amount of liquid (whatever was left):
    - pSL1142: 390ul
- Added 0.7 volumes 100% isopropanol to each of the 1.5mL tubes
  - For 833ul volume tubes, that is 583ul isopropanol
  - For the 7th tube that is:
    - pSL1142: 273ul
- Inverted tubes to mix
- Centrifuged tubes for 45 minutes at 4C in the small centrifuge, 13,000rcf
  - Afterwards, I was able to see pellets!
- Decanted off supernatant in the 1.5mL tubes
- Added 500ul of cold 70% ethanol to each tube
- Centrifuged tubes 30 minutes at 4C 13,000rcf
- Poured off ethanol and let tubes dry ~20 minutes on the bench
- Resuspended pellets in each tube with 40ul 10mM Tris HCl
- Let tubes incubate on the bench overnight

**Qubit 20221028**
- Qubit results:
  - pSL1142 1 = 246ng/ul
  - pSL1142 2 = 4.64ng/ul
  - pSL1142 3 = 348ng/ul
  - pSL1142 4 = 370ng/ul
  - pSl1142 5 = 373ng/ul
  - pSL1142 6 = 367ng/ul
  - pSL1142 7 = 150ng/ul

It looks like I may have lost a pellet for tube 2, but the other concentrations are very high. This is a good sign that I actually got the plasmid this time. I want to run it on a gel to make sure. The plasmid size should be ~14,000bp.

**20221108 gel**
- Because of the high concentration and the large size, it took a couple tries to get the gel conditions correct for visualizing the bands
- I did various dilutions, and also used the previous (bad) extract to compare
- This was a .9% gel run at 90V for 80 minutes
