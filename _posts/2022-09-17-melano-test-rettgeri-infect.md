title: Test Infections on melanogaster and P. rettgeri

## Infecting D. melanogaster with P. rettgeri for Infections Trainings

Goal is to infect these flies and monitor survival. Rob says that they should have about 60% mortality. So this should probably tell me if I am poking too hard or too soft. However these flies are smaller than innubila so that only sort of applies.

Issues with this experiment!!! The flies were **very** hard to poke accurately/consistently because the CO2 pad I was using was clogged. I did not think at the time to move to a different CO2 pad. Turning up the CO2 pressure did not do anything. Honestly I do not trust my poking ability with this experiment so I will likely redo it.

I grew up liquid cultures on 20220916 overnight, then diluted them to an OD of about 1 (0.998) for the actual infections.

I followed the [general infection protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/bacteria_fly_infections.md) except that these are for melanogaster flies, so they go on molasses food after infection. Only males were used in this experiment. The goal was to poke 40 males with the bacteria and 20 males with LB.

Vials and their contents:

|2|P. rettgeri|4:00|7|
|3|P. rettgeri|4:12|9|
|4|P. rettgeri|4:12|9|
|5|LB|4:23|10|
|6|P. rettgeri|4:23|10|
|7|P. rettgeri|4:35|9|
|8|P. rettgeri|4:35|9|
