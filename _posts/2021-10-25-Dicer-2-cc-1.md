## Cell Culture Preparation of Dicer 2 Eggs

### 20211025 Prepping Apple Juice Plates

- Made sure the spoon/scraper had been autoclaved
- In the afternoon, made apple juice yeast plates with 2 streaks of yeast on each plate
- Made fresh medium for this week:
- 1 50mL conical of 10% serum media
  - 5mL of serum
  - 44.5mL of 420 Ex-Cell medium
  - 500ul of 100X antibiotics (Penicillin, Amphotericin B, and Streptomycin)
  - 50ul of 50mg/mL Gentamicin
- 2 50mL conicals of media without serum
  - 49.5mL 420 Ex-Cell medium
  - 500ul of 100X antibiotics (Penicillin, Amphotericin B, and Streptomycin)
  - 50ul of 50mg/mL Gentamicin

### 20211026 Set Up Flies

- Set up 3 vials of flies in the cage with the apple juice plate
- This was around 3pm

### 20211027 Day 1 Cell Culture
- Collected the apple juice plate at ~9:45am and replaced the cage with a new plate for more laying
- Followed the [protocol for preparing primary cell culture](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html)
- Not very many eggs collected with these flies
- Used 420 medium made on 20211025
- For added sterility: after every time doing something out of the TC hood, I sprayed my gloves with ethanol before going back into the hood (centrifuges, etc.)
- Flasks were left to settle overnight and checked the next day
- Supplies were cleaned via protocol and autoclaved that day

### 20211028 Day 2 Cell Culture
- Collected apple juice plate at ~9:45am, flies were placed in the morgue
- Followed the [protocol for preparing primary cell culture](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html)
- More eggs than the day before, but not that many still
- Used 420 medium made on 20211025
- For added sterility: after every time doing something out of the TC hood, I sprayed my gloves with ethanol before going back into the hood (centrifuges, etc.)
- Flasks were left to settle for a few hours before looking at them

The camera is being used in the fly room, so I did not take any good pictures. There are some single cells in the flasks, but not very many. This could be because of the poor laying of the flies.
