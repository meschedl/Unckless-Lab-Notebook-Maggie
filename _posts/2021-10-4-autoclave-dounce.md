## Autoclave Prepare Glass Dounce Homogenizer (for eggs) with Kent (watching) 2021 10 04


**Notes**
- The better homogenizer (there are two gass ones we have) is the one that has the small receptacle and the pestle that has a cross on it
- Wrap the pieces so that when it’s opened, the receptacle is taken out first and can be put in a rack, and you can unwrap the pestle second when you’re ready for it

**Process**
- Made large foil rectangle. Foil is in the drawer under the 1.5mL tube size centrifuge
- Place pestle in foil first and roll in foil 1 or 2 times
- Nestle in dounce next to the rolled pestle, and roll them both up firmly
- Fold in the edges of excess foil
- Close together with autoclave tape
- Autoclave on setting 3 (or use small autoclave in 4055)
