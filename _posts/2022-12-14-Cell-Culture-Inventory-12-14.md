9/13 supernatant 1 flask
- Looking good! Very large are of growth with long stringy cells
- Want to fluid change 
- Think about scraping and re-plating soon

8/11 2 flasks 
- Lots of large clumps of cells but they are all floating 
- Not sure if these are worth keeping but I will let them sit for a while longer 

8/18 1 flask 
- Lots of large clumps of cells but they are all floating 
- Leave to sit for longer 

8/23 1 flask 
- Lots of large clumps of cells but they are all floating 
- Leave to sit for longer

8/24 2 flasks 
- Lots of large clumps of cells but they are all floating, however not all clumps look like they are alive
- Leave to sit for longer

9/27 2 flasks 
- Lots of alive clumps of cells, many of them have settled 
- Little is growing out put this is still promising 
- Fluid change both flasks

- Leave to sit for longer

8/31 1 flask 
- Lots of large clumps of cells but they are all floating 
- Leave to sit for longer

5/02 2 flasks 
- Some areas of good grow out, but flasks are old and growth is slow 
- Still want to keep these though 
- Fluid change these flasks

10/04 plate
- Plates were not a good idea, they do not stay sterile long term. The A and C rows became contaminated 
- This is sad because some of the cells here look good
- I was able to save (hopefully) the B row wells: I scraped them up and put them in individual flasks (3 flasks)

10/05 plate
- Same as with the other plate, the A and C rows got contaminated 
- I scraped up the B row wells and put them in individual flasks (3)


**IMD null**

7/29 4 flasks 
- All of these flasks look pretty good, but the growth is slow
- There are many areas of clumps growing out slowly 
- Interestingly there are these dark stringy cells that are growing the best, I have not seen these before
- Want to fluid change these flasks
