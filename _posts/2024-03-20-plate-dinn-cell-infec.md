title: Plating Dinn-1 and Dv-1 Cells for Infection
---

## Plating 2 24 Well Plates with Dinn-1 and Dv-1 Cells for DiNV Infection and qPCR 

There will be 1 plate for the 0 hour and one plate for the 5 day timepoints. 

Plate Layouts: 

|   | 1       | 2       | 3         | 4         | 5 | 6 |
|---|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|---|---|
| A | Dv-1 CC | Dinn CC | Dv-1 DiNV | Dinn DiNV |   |   |
| B | Dv-1 CC | Dinn CC | Dv-1 DiNV | Dinn DiNV |   |   |
| C | Dv-1 CC | Dinn CC | Dv-1 DiNV | Dinn DiNV |   |   |
| D | Dv-1 CC | Dinn CC | Dv-1 DiNV | Dinn DiNV |   |   |

**Dinn Cells**

- Cannot be counted because of clumpiness
- Scraped a flask and transferred solution to a 15mL conical 
- Spun down the conical for 4 minutes at 800rpm 
- Resuspended the cell pellet in 16mL fresh medium 
- Added 1mL of cell solution to each planned Dinn well in the plates (see layout above)

**Dv-1 cells**

- Scraped a flask and transferred 3mL of solution to a 15mL conical
- Spun down the conical for 4 minutes at 800rpm 
- Resuspended the cell pellet in 1mL fresh medium
- Used 20ul to count in a hemocytometer:    
    - Q1: 663
    - Q2: 767
    - Q3: 555
    - Q4: 550
    - Average: 634
- Cells per mL: 6,337,500
- Used 254ul of cells in 16mL of fresh medium
- Added 1mL of cell solution to each planned Dv-1 well in the plates (see layout above)
- This was about 100,000 cells per well 

Placed plates in 23 incubator overnight
