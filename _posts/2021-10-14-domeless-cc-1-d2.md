## Domeless Egg Collection and Cell Culture Preparation Day 2

**Making New Medium**
- Not enough medium without serum to do the whole process, only about 15mL left and I need 20mL. I decided to make more medium with serum as well just to make everything at the same time (this also saves a 50mL serological pipette)
- I sort of let the solutions warm up before pipetting, but not completely. The conicals were at room temp by the time I used them on the eggs
- All steps were in the tissue culture hood
- 420 medium with 10 % serum
  - 5mL serum
  - 44.5mL 420 medium
  - 500ul 100X antibiotics mix
  - 50ul gentamicin 50mg/mL
- 420 medium no serum
  - 49.5mL 410 medium
  - 500ul 100X antibiotics
  - 50ul gentamicin 50mg/mL

**Collecting Eggs and Cell Culture Prep**
- Followed the exact same protocol as [Domeless day 1](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/12/domeless-cell-culture-1.html)
- Instead of setting the flies up again, they were put into the morgue
- I looked at the flasks after they had settled for the afternoon and they looked good. Lots of single cells, some cell clumps but they were small and few
- Image is at 20X magnification (plus whatever the camera does)
