title: Taking the 3 Week Samples for the DiNV Experimental Evolution
---

## Taking Samples and Fluid Changing Flasks at the 3 Week Mark for Experimental DiNV Evolution in Dinn Cells 

Cells were inoculated on the 26th of Sept [see post here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/09/26/experimental-evolution-inoculation.html). There are 3 replicate flasks that have been left to grow and get infected in the 23C incubator for 21 days. I am only removing supernatant for samples, the cells are not getting passed throughout this experiment, the only thing that happens is a tri-weekly fluid change (once every three weeks). 

All steps took place in the cell culture hood 

- Warmed the 10% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium with antibiotics in the hood to room temperature 
- Prepared 1.5mL tubes to take samples 
- Removed two samples 50ul from each flask before changing fluid and placed into the 1.5mL tubes:

|tube #|flask from|
|---|---|
|11|A|
|12|A|
|13|B|
|14|B|
|15|C|
|16|C|

- Removed 3mL of medium in each flask and discarded it into a 15mL conical. The conical was placed in the autoclave trash when full (should contain virus)
- Added 3mL of 10% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium with antibiotics to each flask gently
- Gently rocked flasks to distribute the medium 
- Placed flasks back in the 23C incubator for another 3 weeks 
- Sample tubes were kept on ice, 3 were chosen for DNA extraction, the other 3 were frozen at -20
