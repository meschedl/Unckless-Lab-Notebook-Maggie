title: 2nd Round of 48 DNA Extracts for Freezing Experiment 
---

## 2nd Round of 48 Single Fly DNA Extractions from Replicate 1 of 16Cq Multi-Day Freezing Experiment 

Samples are from [this 16Cq DiNV infection](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/05/24/16Cq-freezing-exp.html) where male and female flies were infected, and frozen on days 0, 3, 5, and 10 post infection. This is to tell us what proportion of flies are infected when during infection. 

Sample information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a0DyxHrYie6XQzd8wdEeOkemMl94IrNcSeTQ3W0gr8A/edit#gid=0), and samples were randomized for extraction and PCRs.
