title: Week of 20220117 Cell Culture Preparation - SPZ
---

## Cell Culture Preparation of SPZ Eggs

#### 20220118 Making Yeast Plates
- Made fresh yeast paste
- Then that afternoon, made 2 apple juice yeast plates with 2 steaks of yeast on each plate

### 20220119 Setting up SPZ Flies to Lay

- Set up 7 vials of SPZ flies to lay on the yeast plate at about 2pm

### 20220120 Day 1 Cell Culture
- Collected the apple juice plate at ~9:45am and replaced the cage with a new plate for more laying
- Followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html)
- Used 20% FBS Schneider's medium, and 0% FBS Schneider's medium with NO gentamicin made that day
- Flies did not lay very well, and pellets were small (SPZ are known to lay poorly)
- Flasks were left to settle and imaged at the end of the week

### 20220121 Day 2 Cell Culture
- Collected the apple juice plate at ~9:45am and disposed of the flies
- Roughly followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html), but also used the modifications from the [innubila cell culture last week](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/01/10/innubila-laying-plate-test.html) that did not use trypsin and minimized washes. I have a hypothesis that using the trypsin is hurting the cells because the innubila cells from last week look more alive and larger than all of my other cells
- Used the 0% FBS and 20% FBS Schneider's medium with no gentamicin made the day before
- There were many more eggs on the plate this day
- Flasks were imaged in the afternoon
