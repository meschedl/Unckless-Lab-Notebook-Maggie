### Testing Kent's 16 Cq DiNV Fluid as and Infection Liquid on _D. innubila_ With More Replicates

Based off of the previous infection with 16Cq viral fluid, Rob wanted me to do another infection with many more replicates, and equal numbers of control and virus poked flies. Because the fluid came from a mix of supernatants from two different cell culture mediums he was trying, we didn't have a control medium to use for the control pokes. So I used just a sterile needle poke (95% ethanol between each poke) for my controls. 

Using the [D. innubila DiNV infection protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191HoBdHh4KhIpoBTmma_ANXZZ6_2NZV3igZB3zYP5ig/edit) as the process for these infections. 

Flies emerged between 5/3 and 5/4. This means they are 5-6 days old for this infection. The day before, 15 vials were made out with 11 males and 5 females in each. Seven vials of 10 males each will get the control poke, and eight vials of 10 males each will get the DiNV poke.

Fly mortality was measured every day for 3 weeks, and that data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C3ySqTUb8pM2rNR1jLsdNUMgWrqfQIgvzVzjv-qtZAU/edit#gid=0)

Every 3 days, flies were transferred to new food and any dead flies were frozen. At the end of the 3 weeks, all flies in the experiment were frozen. Information on frozen flies can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cC5ZW5fuBKUN46-VxfLpy3Tq8kVqZ7IL_b2a1IvnB9U/edit#gid=0)

No day 0 flies were frozen.
