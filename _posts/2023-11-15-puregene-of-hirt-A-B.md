title: Puregene Extraction, PCRs, and Qubit of Dinn Cells with DiNV

## Puregene DNA Extraction of Same Dinn Cells Infected with DiNV That Were Used to Test The Hirt Extraction, PCRs of All Samples, and Qubit 

**20231115 Puregene Extraction**

If I want to see if the Hirt extraction method is doing anything to increase the ratio of DiNV DNA to cell DNA, I need to compare it to samples extracted with our regular Puregene method. When [harvesting the samples](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/11/14/hirt-extraction-dinn-cells-1.html), I took 50ul from each flask of the supernatant/cell mix and froze that. I used those samples, labeled as A and B, for the Puregene extraction. 

All samples were thawed on ice, [this general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/cell-DNA-extraction-protocol.md) was used, and filter tips were used at all times. Since all samples were presumed positive for DiNV, there was no specific order to them. 2 Extraction controls were done at the same time as well. 

**PCRs 20231116**

The extraction controls, samples A and B, and the [8 samples from the Hirt Extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/11/14/hirt-extraction-dinn-cells-1.html) were all checked with a p47 and TPI PCR. nformation on the primers and their programs can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0), but the TPI program had an extension time of 30 seconds. 

The PCR process followed this [general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md). Afterwards a 1% gel was run for 25 minutes at 100V. There are a few other samples on this gel that I was running at the same time. Samples start at ex ctr 1 and to the right of that.

**Qubit 20231116**

I wanted to quantify these samples to potentially use them for qPCR. I also plan on adding in some infected fly samples for the qPCR, so I quantified those as well. I followed the [Qubit protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCz0SBof6LHE3P_LbftawFyexl8iCECUlvjIcauPYwY/edit).
