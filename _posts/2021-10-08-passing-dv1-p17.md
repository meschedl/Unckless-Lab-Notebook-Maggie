Title: Notes on Passing DV1 Cells with Kent

## Watching Kent Pass (transfer) DV1 Cells to New Flasks

**Steps**
- In tissue culture hood
- Splitting 1 flask into 4 new flasks (25cm2 flasks)
- Made two new conicals of media
  - 45mL Schnieder's drosophila medium
  - 5mL FBS
- Doing a 1:10 split
- Into 1 new flask:
  - 36mL medium
  - 4mL cells _before pipetting: hard tap on the flask to break up the cells stuck to the bottom for a while. Not all cells with come off but most will. Pipette a few times to break up clumps before transferring
- Pipette mis in the 40mL flask to mix up cells with medium
- Transfer 10mL from the 40mL flask to each of the other 3 flasks
  - Line up flasks close and unscrew lids for ease
- New cells are passage 17 because the flask we took from was p16
- Placed these flasks in the new incubator (not refrigerated so it won't go to 23, closer to 27 degrees)
