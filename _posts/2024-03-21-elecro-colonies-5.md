title: Fifth set of Colonies Screened for DiNV Integration

## Screening Colonies from 3/15 Electroporation for DiNV Presence Plate 5

- Made 4 new LB plates with chloramphenicol 
    - Made a solution of 45ul 100% ethanol and 45ul of stock chlor 
    - Spread 20ul of the chlor solution on 4 new LB plates 
    - Let the plates dry a little in the bacteria hood 
    - These plates had grids on them with numbers to keep track of the colonies (see below)
- Prepared a 96 well plate with strip caps with 5ul of molecular grade water in each well 
- For each colony in plate 1 from  the fridge:
    - I picked it up with an autoclaved p2 tip 
    - I dabbed it lightly on the appropriate square in the gridded plate
    - I swirled it for a few seconds in the appropriate well in the 96 well plate 
- This took about and hour to 2 hours

The gridded plates were numbered like this:

Plate 5A:

| 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 |
| 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
| 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |
| 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |

Plate 5B:

| 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 |
| 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 |
| 41 | 42 | 43 | 44 | 45 |
| 46 | 47 | 48 | 49 | 50 |

Plate 5C:

| 51 | 52 | 53 | 54 | 55 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 56 | 57 | 58 | 59 | 60 |
| 61 | 62 | 63 | 64 | 65 |
| 66 | 67 | 68 | 69 | 70 |
| 71 | 72 | 73 | 74 | 75 |

Plate 5D: 

| 76 | 77 | 78 | 79 | 80 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 81 | 82 | 83 | 84 | 85 |
| 86 | 87 | 88 | 89 | 90 |
| 91 | 92 | 93 | 94 |    |
|    |    |    |    |    |

And the 96 well plate:

|   | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| A | 1 | 9  | 17 | 25 | 33 | 41 | 49 | 57 | 65 | 73 | 81 | 89 |
| B | 2 | 10 | 18 | 26 | 34 | 42 | 50 | 58 | 66 | 74 | 82 | 90 |
| C | 3 | 11 | 19 | 27 | 35 | 43 | 51 | 59 | 67 | 75 | 83 | 91 |
| D | 4 | 12 | 20 | 28 | 36 | 44 | 52 | 60 | 68 | 76 | 84 | 92 |
| E | 5 | 13 | 21 | 29 | 37 | 45 | 53 | 61 | 69 | 77 | 85 | 93 |
| F | 6 | 14 | 22 | 30 | 38 | 46 | 54 | 62 | 70 | 78 | 86 | 94 |
| G | 7 | 15 | 23 | 31 | 39 | 47 | 55 | 63 | 71 | 79 | 87 | X  |
| H | 8 | 16 | 24 | 32 | 40 | 48 | 56 | 64 | 72 | 80 | 88 | X  |

**PCRs**

- Then, the solution in the 96 well plate was used for colony PCR 
- The [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) was used, however 1ul of the bacteria-water solution was used instead of DNA 
- I used lef 4 as the primer to amplify DiNV DNA because it had not shown any off-target amplification before 
- 16S is a control for bacteria presence in the sample
- PCR mixes:

|reagent|lef 4|16S|
|---|---|---|
|GoTaq|500ul|500ul|
|F primer|25ul|25ul|
|R primer|25ul|25ul|
|molec grade water|350ul|350ul|

Reactions were run for 30 cycles. Primer information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit?usp=drive_link).

The gels from this plate can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pwx0ID1jVihEXzmOOn3srmj0Rubko_3q). No colony was positive for DiNV.
