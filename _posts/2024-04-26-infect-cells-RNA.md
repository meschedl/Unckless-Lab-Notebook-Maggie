## Infecting Dinn-1 Cells with P4 DiNV for RNA

Infected Dinn-1 cells needed for time course for RNASeq, flies for day 0, 1, 3, and 5. Cells had already been plated a few days before [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/04/22/place-cells-RNA.html). 

I used the 250ul aliquot of P4 DiNV, this was not diluted (see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RHdErRIw14FFfQLZ-Elngy35rnMQVDSuWZvyMcucVT0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)), Rob and I decided that using 20ul seemed like a good amount for each plate of cells to have the max ability to see all cells infected. 

- Thawed virus tube 81 on ice 
- Got LN2 for day 0 cells 
- Scraped up the wells for the day 0 cells with pipette tips inside the hood (Plate A)
- Transferred the solution to 1.5mL tubes per well 
- Centrifuged tubes 1 min at 1000g to pellet the cells 
- Removed the supernatant to separate tubes 
- Flash froze the cell pellets: 

| sample number | treatment | day |
|---------------|-----------|-----|
| 1             | NA        | 0   |
| 2             | NA        | 0   |
| 3             | NA        | 0   |
| 4             | NA        | 0   |

For innoculating plates:

- Pipette mixed virus solution 
- Added 20ul of P4 virus solution to wells C2, C3, C4, and C5 of plates B, C, and D 
- Added 20ul of cell culture medium to wells B2, B3, B4, and B5 of plates B, C, and D
- Rocked plates back and forth a bit 
- Placed plates back in the incubator 


Freezing plates later on:

- On the day specified I followed the same process as above to freeze the cells
- Scraped up the wells for the day cells with pipette tips inside the hood 
- Transferred the solution to 1.5mL tubes per well 
- Centrifuged tubes 1 min at 1000g to pellet the cells 
- Removed the supernatant to separate tubes 
- Flash froze the cell pellets
