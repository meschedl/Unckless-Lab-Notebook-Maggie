## Preparing Libraries from RNA from Dinn-1 Cells Infected with DiNV Set 2

Using the [NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina®](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/e7760-nebnext-ultra-ii-directional-rna-library-prep-kit-for-illumina?srsltid=AfmBOooEaq2hqy6ZXgppx6-a11i94GWF5VuSQBliTbnCSLQqwIlQNSGk). I had previously aliquoted out all the reagents into single-use tubes for 2 sets of 8 sample reactions, 2 sets of 21 sample reactions, and 2 sets of 16 sample reactions. 

This lib prep kit is used in conjunction with [NEBNext® Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/e7490-nebnext-polya-mrna-magnetic-isolation-module) for mRNA isolation. 

1000ng (1ug) input RNA was used for each sample. All sample info can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aVQSpKKzx3eQxTVYypo4MT4yn4GReBTTmdY28pgBiQA/edit?gid=735835936#gid=735835936).

**Bead clean after 2nd strand synthesis** 

Note: used the multichannel for these 

- Warmed and resuspended Ampure XP beads to room temp with gentle swirling 
- Prepared fresh 80% ethanol
- After program, placed samples on bench 
- Added 144ul Ampure beads to each tube (1.8x) and pipette mixed 10x
- Placed tubes on the orbital shaker at 150rpm for 10 minutes 
- Placed tubes on the magnet rack, then placed the rack on the orbital shaker for at least 10 minutes 
    - the volume is really high here so it takes a long time for the beads to come to the magnet 
- Remove the clear supernatant (over 200ul)
- Add 200ul 80% ethanol to each tube still on the rack avoiding the beads 
- Remove the ethanol
- Add another 200ul 80% ethanol to each tube still on the rack avoiding the beads 
- Remove all ethanol, go back in after the p200 with a p20 and remove any residual liquid 
- Look at tubes and remove any droplets of ethanol present on the sides of the tubes with a pipette tips 
- Resuspend beads off the magnet in 53ul of 0.1X TE buffer 
- Incubate the tubes on the shaker at 150rpm for 5 min 
- Make a new set of strip tubes
- Place tubes on the magnet 
- Remove the clear supernatant (50ul) to the new set of tubes 
- Place samples on ice 

**End Prep**

- Thawed end prep buffer and end prep enzyme on ice
    - Note that the buffer had a lot of precipitate, I had just warmed it to room temp and mixed it a lot before placing on ice. This could be because the kit is expired 
- Prepared end prep master mix on ice:
    - 7ul end prep buffer * 22 = 154ul 
    - 3ul end prep enzyme * 22 = 66ul 
- Pipette mixed and kept on ice 
- Added 10ul end prep mix to each sample 
- Pipette mixed each tube 10x with 50ul 
- Placed tubes in thermocycler NRNA6 lis set to 105:
    - 30 min at 20C
    - 30 min at 65C
    - 4C hold
- Afterwards, placed samples on ice 
- You must either cool the lid down after this or use another thermocycler because the next program needs the lid at 20C 

**Adapter Ligation**

- Thawed NEB next adapter, adapter buffer, ligation enhancer, ligation mix, and USER enzyme on ice 
- Diluted NEB next adapter by 5 (based on kit recommendations for 1ug input)
    - I need 55ul total of adapter 
    - 11ul NEBNext adapter 
    - 44ul adapter buffer 
    - Vortexed and spun down 
- Made adapter ligation mix on ice:
    - 1ul ligation enhancer * 22 = 22ul 
    - 30ul ligation mix * 22 = 660ul (this is very viscous)
    - Pipette to mix (very important, DNA ligase cannot be vortexed)
- Added 31ul ligation mix to each sample
- Added 2.5ul diluted adapter to each sample 
- Pipette mixed each sample with 80ul 10 times (viscous)
- Placed in thermocycler 20C for 15 min - NRNA7 lid set to OFF!

- Took tubes out of thermocycler to bench 
- Added 87ul beads to each tube and pipette mixed 10x 
- Placed tubes on the orbital shaker at 150rpm for 10 minutes 
- Placed tubes on the magnet rack, then placed the rack on the orbital shaker for some time if needed
    - the volume is still high here and may need shaking
- Remove the clear supernatant (over 200ul)
- Add 200ul 80% ethanol to each tube still on the rack avoiding the beads 
- Remove the ethanol
- Add another 200ul 80% ethanol to each tube still on the rack avoiding the beads

**Index Amplification**

- During the bead clean, thawed the index place on ice, then spun it down in the large centrifuge 
- Index pairs for each sample had already been planned, see [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aVQSpKKzx3eQxTVYypo4MT4yn4GReBTTmdY28pgBiQA/edit?gid=735835936#gid=735835936)
- Thawed Q5 mix on ice, vortexed, and spun down 
- Added 25ul Q5 mix to each sample
- Added 10ul of the **planned index** to each tube - plate needs to be pierced with pipette tip to get into single use wells 
- Pipette mixed each tube with 40ul and spun down tubes 
- Placed tubes in thermocycler NRNA9 lid at 105:
    - 98C 30 sec
    - _98C 10 sc_
    - _65C 75 sec_
    - 65C 5 min
    - 4C hold 
    - Note that italic lins were cycled 10 times (this was later changed to 9)
