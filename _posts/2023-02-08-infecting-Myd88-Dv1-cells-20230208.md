---

## Using 12 Well Plates of Myd88 and Dv-1 Cells to Infect With DiNV and Take Day 0 Samples 

Using the day 26 innubila primaries infected with DiNV fluid from Kent for this infection experiment.

- Thawed 6 40ul aliquots of the cell fluid with DiNV on ice 
- Prepared 12 1.5mL tubes to put the supernatant of the day 0 wells into. Sample names can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fi2Mtt8IbXCSx1YuVR9IfkkJxQe9vNylgJKMFb96UTY/edit#gid=0)
- Did all processes in the cell culture hood
- Pipette mixed vials of DiNV fluid before using 
- Added 20ul of DiNV fluid to wells A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2 in both the day 0 and day 5 plates 
- After adding to the well, I gently rocked the plate back and forth 
- For the day 0 plate, removed all the supernatant from each well and put it in the respective 1.5mL tube 
- Added 1mL of 1X PBS to each now "empty" well in the day 0 plate too have fluid for the cells 
- Taped up the plate and put the supernatant tubes in a new box and put it all in the -80 
- Put the day 5 plate in the 23C incubator until Monday
