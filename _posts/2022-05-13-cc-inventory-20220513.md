title: Cell Culture Inventory on 20220513

## Cell Culture Check-in on 20220513

**Also made Primary Cell Culture this week:**
- For these cells, the egg laying scenario was slightly different:
  - Flies were put on plates in mid afternoon Saturday and left overnight
  - Then flies were swapped to a new plate in the morning on Sunday and left for 24 hours
  - Plates were not collected until at least 10:30am to facilitate morning laying
  - Then plates were left to "mature" (eggs to cellularize) for 2-3 hours after being taken off before the primary cell culture process began
  - The second cc plate was put on regularly
- On 05/09 2 primary cc flasks were make for SPZ flies, and 2 for innubila
- On 05/10 3 primary cc flasks were make for SPZ flies, and 2 for innubila

03/30 myd88 cell scraped secondary
- 3 flasks
- from 02/03
