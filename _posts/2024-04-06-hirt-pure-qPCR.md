qPCR of Hirt and Puregene Extracted Dinn-1 Cells To Compare DiNV DNA, PIF3 and TPI Primers 

Using PIF3 (virus) and TPI primers for this qPCR, using samples that were extracted [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/04/02/Hirt-extract-for-DiNV.html), puregene samples were added in with last cell DNA extraction 


- Samples were kept on ice
- Reagents were thawed and kept on ice
- Master mixes for each primer were made and kept on ice until use 
- TPI master mix
    - 130ul Sso
    - 13ul TPI F primer
    - 13ul TPI R primer 
    - 78ul molecular grade water 
- PIF3 master mix
    - 130ul Sso
    - 13ul PIF3 F primer
    - 13ul PIF3 R primer 
    - 78ul molecular grade water
- 9ul of primer was added to each well of a qPCR plate
- 1ul of diluted (or not) sample was added to the appropriate well in the plate 
- The wells were pipette mixed 10X with a multichannel to mix
- The plate was sealed with the biorad seal
- The plate was spun down for 3 minutes at 4000rpm 
- The plate was brought to the qPCR machine and run on the p47 program
