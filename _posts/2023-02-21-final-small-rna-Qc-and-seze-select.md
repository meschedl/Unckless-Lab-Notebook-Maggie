title: TapeStations and Final Size Selection for Wen-Juan's Small RNA Libraries 
---

## Post-Size Selection and Clean Up of 1 Small RNA Library, Final Small RNA Library Size Selection and Cleanup, and Final Libraries TapeStations 

I was concerned that the strange TapeStation results from the post-size selection libraries (peaks at ~175bp) could have been because the libraries were in the electrophoresis buffer from the Blue Pippin instead of something like TE buffer. I had done the Monarch DNA purification for the libraries that had been size selected _after_ the TapeStation (as the protocol recommends), which can be seen [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/01/26/Blue-Pippin-5-Sample-Small-RNA.html). I decided to TapeStation one sample after cleanup to see if the size of the libraries would be different in TE buffer. 

**20230209 TapeStation Library 3**
- I chose sample #3 because it had the highest concentration in the [previous TapeStation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m0yAocffW9VLs_ZE7eqysDZrAkHuzw8P/view?usp=share_link) so I thought it would be ok to used 2ul from it for this test tapestation 
- I thawed the library on ice and took 2ul down to the Genome Core
- Took out the High Sensitivity D1000 sample buffer and D1000 screen tape from their fridge to equilibrate to room temperature
    - Note, the GSC does not purchase ladders for the HS D1000, they only use electronic ladders
- Once the reagents were at room temp, vortexed and spun down the sample buffer
- Got the TapeStation tube strip and strip caps
- Added 2ul of sample buffer to 1 tube in the TapeStation tube strip
- Added 2ul of library to the tube with sample buffer
- Vortexed tubes for 1 minute
- Spun down tube
- Logged into computer and turned on TapeStation, opened software
- Loaded sample tubes, took of the caps gently, and loaded in the screen tape
- Selected 1 well and named them, right clicking the “ladder” position and changing it to electronic ladder so I could put a sample in the first position
- Closed the lid and pressed start
- Machine ran for ~5 minutes
- A folder is created for the date, exported the results as a pdf and saved it to that folder. Then renamed the folder by adding initials and Unckless after it
- Took out tubes, pipette tips, and screentape from the machine, put the screentape back in the fridge as there were spots left, and shut down the machine
- Saved pdf on flashdrive
- PDF can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16tJ-R03Scw-khaw6Pvo_9ymlV6iYN20U/view?usp=share_link)

This average peaks size of 157bp is basically what we were expecting originally, so this was good. It is likely that the electrophoresis buffer slightly messed up the size estimation. 

I decided to size select the last sample the same way I had done previously, and then tapestation all of the libraries (except for #3) again once they were purified with the Monarch kit. 

**20230221 library 1 size selection, purification, and TapeStations on remaining libraries**

Size Selection library 1 
- The only sample I had not size selected was library 1, because it has low concentration, I decided to use the entire 30ul of the library 
- Using BDQ3010 3% cassettes with internal marker Q3
- Brought Marker Q3 and the electrophoresis buffer to room temp (stored in 4C), flicked to mix, and spun down
- Thawed sample 1 on ice
- Make a new set of strip tubes. Added 30ul of library 1 to a the strip tube
- Mixed 10ul of Marker Q3 with the 30ul of sample, pipette mixed and spun down
- Brought samples, pipette, tips, and cassettes to the Genome Core
- Turned on the machine
- Selected the 20230215-UNK-SmRNA-110-170 program (saved from [previous](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/01/26/Blue-Pippin-5-Sample-Small-RNA.html)). I tried to turn off the other lanes beside the one I was going to use, but this ended up not working because I had the reference lanes still selected (needed to be turned off as well) so voltage still ran through the rest of the cassette. That means I can't use that cassette again, but that should be ok
- Calibrate optics on the machine:
    - Put the calibration fixture into the machine and closed the lid
    - Pressed calibrate
- Inspected cassette:
    - Are there any cracks or breaks in the agarose? - No
    - Are there bubbles in the optical chamber of the agarose? - No
- Prepared cassette:
    - Dislodged bubbles from behind elution wells
    - Placed cassette in nest making sure the bubbles don’t return
    - Removed adhesive
    - Removed all buffer from elution wells, sucked up from multiple orientations
    - Replaced buffer in elution wells with 40ul of fresh electrophoresis buffer
    - Sealed elution well with tape strip
    - Checked buffer level in sample wells, made sure it is flush with the gel
- Closed lid and performed the continuity test - Pass
- Loading sample:
    - Re-checked buffer level in sample wells
    - Removed 40ul of buffer from first sample well - followed liquid level down with pipette tip
    - Pipette mixed the  sample, then loaded it into the first sample well - followed liquid level up with pipette tip
- Closed lid
- Double checked that the correct protocol is loaded and then pressed start
- Program ran for about 70 minutes, and the marker was visible so the 1st well eluted the sample
- Removed the entire volume in the elution well and placed in a new 1.5mL tube. This was about 40ul

Library 1 post size selection Monarch Cleanup 
- Total volume out of the Blue Pippin is ~40ul, and the protocol says to use the 7:1 binding buffer to sample ratio
- Added 252ul of DNA Cleanup Binding Buffer to the sample tube
- Pipette mixed to mix the sample
- Prepared a spin column 
- Added the ~300ul of sample to the spin column
- Centrifuged the spin column at 16,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Discarded the supernatant
- Added 200ul DNA Wash Buffer to the column
- Centrifuged the column at 16,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Discarded the supernatant
- Added another 200ul DNA Wash Buffer to the column
- Centrifuged the column at 16,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Discarded the supernatant
- Centrifuged the column “dry” for 1 minute at 16,000 rcf
- Placed the spin column in a new 1.5mL tube 
- Added 20ul of DNA Elution Buffer (TE buffer) to the column and let sit for 1 minute
- Centrifuged column for 1 minute at 16,000 rcf

TapeStation of post size selection and cleaned up libraries 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 
- Thawed libraries 2,4,5, and 6 on ice 
- Aliquoited 2ul from each library into new strip tubes 
- Took samples and pipettes and tips down to the genome codre
- Took out the High Sensitivity D1000 sample buffer and D1000 screen tape from their fridge to equilibrate to room temperature
    - Note, the GSC does not purchase ladders for the HS D1000, they only use electronic ladders
- Once the reagents were at room temp, vortexed and spun down the sample buffer
- Got the TapeStation tube strip and strip caps
- Added 2ul of sample buffer to each of 5 tubes in the TapeStation tubes
- Added 2ul of library to each tube with sample buffer. I went in order of 1-6 (without 3)
- Vortexed tubes for 1 minute
- Spun down tube
- Logged into computer and turned on TapeStation, opened software
Loaded sample tubes, took of the caps gently, and loaded in the screen tape
- Selected 5 wells and named them, right clicking the “ladder” position and changing it to electronic ladder so I could put a sample in the first position
- Closed the lid and pressed start
- Machine ran for ~5 minutes
- A folder is created for the date, exported the results as a pdf and saved it to that folder. Then renamed the folder by adding initials and Unckless after it
- Took out tubes, pipette tips, and screentape from the machine, put the screentape back in the fridge as there were spots left, and shut down the machine
- Saved pdf on flashdrive

I took the average peak bp and the concentration from these TapeStations and calculated the molarity [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g7VCNogjnWyEvJDrV9c9ze8MJJcm_1nR6c5tgExZxSY/edit#gid=0)
