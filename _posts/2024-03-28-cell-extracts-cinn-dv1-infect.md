title: DNA Extraction from Dinn-1 and Dv-1 Cells Inocculatd with DiNV 
---

## DNA Extraction of Dinn-1 and Dv-1 Cells Infected with 10ul of P4 DiNV 

Samples were infected on [20240322](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/22/inocul-dinn-dv1.html), and a day 0 plate and a day 5 plate were frozen at -80. 

Samples:

- Plates were thawed from 80 on ice (took a while)
- Then each well was pipette mixed to homogenize the cells
- 50ul of solution from each well was added to a 1.5mL tube and placed on ice (see table above)
- 1ul of 1/1000 lambda DNA solution was added to each sample for an extraction control 
- Then the extraction proceeded with the [Cell DNA Extraction Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/cell-DNA-extraction-protocol.md) exactly 
- Samples were stored at -80 afterwards and were not quantified before qPCR
