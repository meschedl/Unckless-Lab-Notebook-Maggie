title: Making Glycerol Stocks from the pSPIN-BAC and Checking Antibiotic Resistance 
---

## Picking 3 Colonies to Make Glycerol Stocks for the pSPIN BAC and Checking for Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol Resistance  

**20231215 Glycerol Stocks**

The bacteria ([eletroporated here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/12/14/making-LB-electroporate-pSPIN-BAC-from-Genewiz.html)) had grown on the Kanamycin resistance plates, so I felt pretty sure that the colonies had taken up the plasmid, but I chose 3 colonies, 1 from each plate to make glycerol stocks just in case some of them didn't seem to work. 

Colonies chosen here:

Three slightly less then 2mL LB flasks were made per colony. Because the volume was less than 2mL (the usual, next time I will prepare my own 2mL flasks), I used 0.9ul of stock Kanamycin in each flask. Usually for 2mL it is 1ul. The colonies were picked with autoclaved tips and dropped into the flasks, each colony got picked 3 times (you only need a small amount of bacteria to seed these flasks). Flasks were then grown overnight at 37C in the shaking incubator. 

**20231216 Finishing Stocks and Plating**

From the stocks I planned to test whether the bacteria also had chloramphenicol resistance by plating each stock on Kan, Chlor, and Kan+Chlor plates. 

- All flasks had grown good amounts of bacteria overnight
- 2 cryotubes were made for each colony for stocks:
    - 144 - colony 1
    - 145 - colony 2
    - 146 - colony 3 
- Each cryotube gets 750ul of culture and 750ul of 50% sterile filtered glycerol 
- Stocks were pipette mixed and stored in the -80 when not using 
- 9 plates were warmed in the 37C incubator 
- 6 plates would get Kan and 6 plates would get Chlor, with 3 overlapping 
- I know these all grow with Kan but that is a good positive control 
- For the Kanamycin I wanted to spread 20ul on each plate:
    - 45ul of stock Kanamycin
    - 75ul of molecular grade water 
    - Pipette mixed, and spread on the plates with a sterile spreader 
    - Let these plates absorb for ~5 minutes before adding on Chloramphenicol 
- For the Chloramphenicol plates I also wanted 20ul to spread on the plate and the same dilution factor, 20ug/mL on 25mL plates
    - 45ul of stock Chloramphenicol
    - 75ul of 100% ethanol 
    - Pipette mixed, and spread on the plates with a sterile spreader
- After the antibiotics were set in each plate was spread with their planned colony using a sterile loop 
- The plates were left to grow upsidedown in the 37C incubator overnight 
- Plates checked in the morning of the 17th, colonies 1 and 2 grew on every plate, colony 3 did not grow on plates with Chloramphenicol:

Colony 3 Chloramphenicol:

Colony 3 Kanamycin:

It looks like colony 3 is not useful to use, and I am glad I tried different colonies for this.
