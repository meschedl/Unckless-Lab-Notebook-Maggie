## Using GFP Plasmid to Transfect Dinn-1, Myd88, and Dv-1 Cells to See Transfection Ability 

Cells had already been plated [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/12/dinn-transfect-plate.html), and [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/16/seeding-cells-transfec-infec.html) in a 12 well plate. Plate layout: 

|   | 1                |   | 2                 |   | 3                  |   | 4                  |   |

Using the Miris Bio Trans-IT 2020 transfection reagent and the pAc5 GFP plasmid that have been used [previously](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/05/26/Plate-9-Transfection.html). The pAc5 plasmid is already concentrated to 1ug/ul for use. 

- Thawed plasmid and reagent 
- Vortexed and spun them down 
- All processes done in the hood 
- Made 2 mixes: 
- Tube 1:
    - control 
    - 400ul of no serum schneider's medium 
- Tube 2: 
    - reagent 
    - 800ul of no serum schneider's medium 
    - 8ul concentrated plasmid 
    - 8ul of 2020 reagent 
    - pipette mixed gently
- Incubated tube 2 for 30 min in the hood for complexes to form 
- Then, added reagents dropwise to their respective wells (see layout above)
    - 100ul of control to control wells
    - 102ul of reagent to reagent wells 
- Rocked plate back and forth for a minute
- Placed plate in the 23 incubator for overnight 

This plate was looked at every 24 hours for 5 days in Dr. Ackley's scope to look for GFP presence in the cells. Day 5 was the best imaged because each cell type had GFP positive cells. All images can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tiMWF0F8icoTfC1MfJJqttwN4Cg5vLCf)
