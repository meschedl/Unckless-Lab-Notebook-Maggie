## Testing mixing of pSPIN-BAC bacteria and DiNV DNA at Room Temp without Electroporation

I wondered wether the change from ice to warm buffer made the virus DNA go inside the bacteria cells (kinda like a heat shock) even without the electroporation and that was why all samples showed virus positive even if no electro treatment (previous tests). So if I did the process at room temp then maybe that wouldn't happen. 

**Mixing**

- Prepared 2 tubes of 975ul SOC buffer to room temp
- Using last of exo-20 sample and a 1:10 diluted exo-20 sample 
- Warmed LB and pSPIN-BAC cells to room temp 
- pSPIN-BAC DNA no electro - tube 12A and 12B 
    - Added 25ul pSPIN-BAC cells to a tube 12A
    - Added 2ul 20-exo DNA
    - Immediately added 975ul of room temp SOC buffer and mix
    - Transferred 490ul to a 1.5mL tube labeled "12B"
    - Keep 12B rt
    - Placed 12A in the 30C shaking incubator 1 hour
- pSPIN-BAC diluted DNA no electro - tube 13A and 13B 
    - Added 25ul pSPIN-BAC cells to a tube 13A
    - Added 2ul 1:10 diluted 20-exo DNA
    - Immediately added 975ul of room temp SOC buffer and mix
    - Transferred 490ul to a 1.5mL tube labeled "13B"
    - Keep 13B rt
    - Placed 13A in the 30C shaking incubator 1 hour

**Washing Cells**
- Centrifuged B tubes 3 min at 6,000g
- Removed supernatant 
- Resuspended pellets in 200ul LB 
- Repeated above steps 4 more times for 5 washes
- Removed final supernatant and froze pellets of bacteria at -80C 
- For A tubes after their 1 hour incubation, I also did 5 washes with 200ul of LB 
- These tubes were not frozen and immediately went to DNA extraction 

**DNA extraction**
- Used both the A and B tubes of bacteria cell pellets 
- B tubes were taken from -80 and thawed on ice 
- DNA extraction was done exactly as described in a [previous post](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/02/19/electroporation-test.html)

**PCRs on DNA Extracts**

- The point was test all of the DNA samples for if they have retained DiNV DNA with PCR 
- 4 PCRs were run on the samples, and the process followed the [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) completely. Master mix volumes are listed here:

|reagent|p47|16S|lef 9|lef 4|
|---|---|---|---|
|GoTaq|32.5ul|32.5ul|32.5ul|32.5ul|
|F primer|1.625ul|1.625ul|1.625ul|1.625ul|
|R primer|1.625ul|1.625ul|1.625ul|1.625ul|
|molecular grade water|22.75ul|22.75ul|22.75ul|

- All PCR programs were run for 30 cycles, and program information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0)
- 1% gel was run at 90V for 45 minutes to resolve the bands:
