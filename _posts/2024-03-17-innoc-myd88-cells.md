title: Inoculating Myd88 Cells with DiNV
---

## Infecting 24 Well Plates of Dv-1 and Myd88 Cells with DiNV to See if Myd88 Cells Grow Virus 

Cells were [already plated the day before](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/16/seeding-cells-transfec-infec.html) and have settled to the plates. 

There is a plate for day 0 just after inoculation and a plate for day 5 after inoculation. 

Plate layout:

|   | 1       | 2        | 3       | 4         | 5          | 6         |
|---|---------|----------|---------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| A | Dv-1 CC | Myd88 CC | X | Dv-1 DiNV | Myd88 DiNV | X |
| B | Dv-1 CC | Myd88 CC | X | Dv-1 DiNV | Myd88 DiNV | X |
| C | Dv-1 CC | Myd88 CC | X | Dv-1 DiNV | Myd88 DiNV | X |
| D | Dv-1 CC | Myd88 CC | X | Dv-1 DiNV | Myd88 DiNV | X |

- I wanted to add 10ul of passage 4 virus to each well that gets infected, but I wanted the volume added to be larger to mix more
- So I diluted 250ul of P4 DiNV with 375ul of medium 
- Then added 25ul of that solution to each virus well 
- And 25ul of straight medium to the control wells
- Rocked the plates back and forth a bit 
- Day 0 plate was placed in the -80 immediately
- The day 5 plate was placed in the 23C incubator for 5 days, when it was also placed in the -80
