title: Using Dinn Cells Infected with DiNV Pellet and Clarification Pellet for the Hirt HMW DiNV DNA Extraction 
--- 

## Another Set of Hirt DNA Extractions for DiNV DNA using Pellet of Cells Infected with DiNV and the Clarification Pellet from DiNV Purification

I had some leftover pellets of cells infected with DiNV [from a previous hirt extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/11/14/hirt-extraction-dinn-cells-1.html) where I only used the supernatant. Those 2 samples I called 16 and 17. Additionally I took two more samples of the clarification pellet from DiNV purification to use for the extraction. That pellet had been frozen at -80C by Kent, so it did have to go through a freeze thaw to get used. Those samples were 18 and 19. These probably aren't the best samples (a frozen and thawed pellet and the clarification pellet which I know has degraded DNA) but I want to use this DNA to test and exonuclease on to see if that gets rid of non-circular DNA. 

For the clarification pellet samples I added 100ul to 1.5mL tubes, spun them down at 2000rpm for 1 minute and removed the supernatant. It turned out that the cell pellet samples still had some liquid in them but I decided not to remove it. 

**Lysis and Chromosomal DNA Precipitation**

- The small centrifuge was placed in the 4C at least an hour before use
- All processes were done in the fume hood
- Added 147ul 50mM Tris HCl, 10mM EDTA to all the samples
- Prepared 5mg/mL RNase A
    - 6ul molecular grade water 
    - 6ul 10mg/mL RNase A
    - Vortexed and spun down to mix
- Added 3ul of 5mg/mL RNase A to each sample
- Added 150ul of 1.2% SDS to each tube
- Inverted tubes, gently resuspended pellet with clipped pipette tips to mix 
- Incubated tubes on bench for ~25 minutes to lyse/digest all cells/virus
    - This seemed to work, the cell pellets had disappeared by 15 minutes, the clarification pellet samples got better, but I don't think everything got broken down and I might have added too much sample
- Precipitated chromosomal DNA and cellular debris by added 210ul of 3M CsCl, 1M potassium acetate, 0.67M acetic acid
  - A white precipitate immediately started forming in the tubes, I pipette mixed the solution with clipped pipette tips
- Immediately placed tubes on ice for 30 minutes incubation 
- Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000rcf at 4 degrees C
- During this time I made fresh 80% and 100% ethanol and put them in the -20 freezer to cool
- Pipetted off supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes 
- Centrifuged new tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000rcf at 4 degrees C
  - There was basically no new precipitate here that pelleted, but samples 18 and 19 did have floating debris that I could not get avoid picking up
- Moved supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes 
    - 16: 490ul
    - 17: 500ul
    - 18: 500ul
    - 19: 500ul

**Phenol Chloroform Extraction**

- Still in the fume hood
- Added equal volume of cold phenol-chlorofomr-isoamy-alcohol to the tubes (Note!! phenol-chloroform-isoamy-alcohol is in two phases, I think you are supposed to use the bottom layer for this, see [x](https://hermanlab.unl.edu/protocols/phenolppt.html))
    - 16: 490ul
    - 17: 500ul
    - 18: 500ul
    - 19: 500ul
- Mixed tubes up and down and then put them on an orbital mixer in the hood for 10 minutes
- Centrifuged tubes at 16,000rcf at room temp for 15 minutes
- Looked for phase separation
  - Phase separation looked great, there were two distinct layers in each tube, however in the 18-19 tubes there was a white film in between the two layers, which ended up making it hard to remove the top layer below
- Transferred top aqueous phase to new final labeled tubes (did not use clipped tips here for better pipetting )
    - I did not try to get absolutely everything, I did not want to suck up both phases
    - 10: 490ul
    - 11: 500ul
    - 12: 480ul
    - 13: 470ul 
- Added 0.1X tube liquid volume of new 3M NaOAc to each tube
    - 10: 49ul
    - 11: 50ul
    - 12: 48ul 
    - 13: 47ul
- Added 900ul of cold 100% ethanol to each tube
- Inverted tubes to mix
    - I did not see anything that looked like DNA
- Placed tubes in the -20 overnight

**20240105 DNA Precipitation**

- Took tubes out of the freezer and centrifuged tubes at max speed at 4C for 30 minutes
  - Tubes had not frozen in the freezer
  - Each tube looked like they had a pellet
- Poured off supernatant into a waste container
- Added 500ul of cold fresh 80% ethanol and inverted twice to mix
- Centrifuged tubes at max speed at 4C for 30 minutes
- Poured off supernatant into a waste container
- Let tubes dry ~30 minutes upside-down on the bench
- Resuspended pellets in 25ul of 10mM tris HCl and put in the 4C
