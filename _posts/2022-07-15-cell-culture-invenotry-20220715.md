## Cell Culture Inventory on 20220715

I started taking pictures of the flasks I throw out to show the comparison of a flask that looks good/promising vs a flask where I think all the cells are dead.

### _melanogaster_

SPZ primary 5/10
- 3 flasks
- Does not look like any cells are alive
- Nothing is attached, they are all floating
- Some places have clumps that settled but they look dead
- Thrown out

SPZ primary 05/09
- 2 flasks

SPZ primary 06/17
- 3 flasks
- Same as 6/16
