## PCRs for CO1, TPI, and p47 to Test for Virus Presence in 1st Freezing Experiment 

There are 175 samples for PCR, and they were organized into two sets of 88/89 samples to do at a time. For information on the samples, see [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a0DyxHrYie6XQzd8wdEeOkemMl94IrNcSeTQ3W0gr8A/edit#gid=818528799) which has dates of PCRs and results from the PCRs in spreadsheet form.  
All PCRs followed [this general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) and used primers CO1, TPI, and p47 (not qPCR) where specifications can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0). Note that CO1 and TPI were done in the same PCR reaction, and both sets of primers were put into the same master mix. I also did all the p47 PCRs twice, once with 35 cycles and once with 30 cycles. All previous data for p47 PCRs has been done with 30 cycles. It is not clear which number of cycles is the best to do.
