## Testing the Best Food for innubila Infections and the Best Control for Virus Infections

I wanted to test whether mushrooms are required for good survival after control infections, so I used regular instant food with or without the mushroom piece. These were the regular volumes of instant food/water and included a cotton roll in each option.   
I also wanted to test what would be the best control treatment for Virus infections when the liquid is cell culture supernatant. There are 3 treatments per food group: no poking but on CO2 for 5 minutes, poke with needle dipped in Schneider's medium, or poked with needle dipped in complete cell culture medium. Complete medium means 10% FBS Schnedier's medium with antibiotics: Streptomycin, Pennicillin, Gentamicin, and Amphotericin B. 

Infections followed [this general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/bacteria_fly_infections.md) except for differences in the treatments and the food (see above).

Flies emerged between 11/24 and 11/27, meaning that they are 5-7 days old today. They were separated out into vials of ~12 males and a few females for easier infections on 11/28. There should be ~240 male flies for the infection tests. Every treatment should get about 40 flies.

Vials will be checked every ~24 hours to monitor mortality. This data will be recorded [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WHBrN7ut26xjhK8-dbCir6s_gRm1ymHKhB3W38MlKVg/edit#gid=0). Every 3 days the flies will be transferred to new food, and CO2 will be used in the process (to avoid falling mushrooms)/
