## Doing CO1 and p47 PCRs on DNA from [Single Fly DNA Extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/09/29/dna-extracts-48-innubila-dinv-test.html) and [extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/10/06/more-dna-extracts-48-innubila-dinv-test.html) to Test for DiNV Infection

Samples for PCR in the layout they were in for the plates:

| A | 119 | 56  | 30  | 40  | 63 | 59  | 35  | 38  | 92  | 64  | 3   | 102 |
| B | 98  | 106 | 117 | 81  | 11 | 100 | 77  | 68  | 57  | 79  | 9   | 34  |

PCR followed [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md) using the CO1 and p47 primers, and _n_ number of 90, and cycling conditions indicated [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0). Note that I forgot to do a positive and negative control for these. I also became concerned that there was some splashing between samples when vortexing the plate because the seal may have not been fully on. I will likely have to do at least the p47 PCRs again.

Separate gels run for both primer sets, 1% gel, 90V, 30 minutes for CO1, 40 minutes for p47. Note that the stain did not mix well for the CO1 gel, but that basically all samples seemed to have a band anyways.
