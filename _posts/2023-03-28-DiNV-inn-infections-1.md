### Testing Concentrated DiNV Fluid with _D. innubila_ Infections Round 1 

In this project Huan and I are testing the concentrated fluid from DinnDiNV 4 cells on both D. innubila and D. falleni. He will do 2 infections on falleni and 1 on innubila, and I will do 2 infections on innbila and 1 on falleni. 

Infection liquid is from the [ultrafiltration concentrated fluids](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/02/22/Viral-fluid-concentration-test.html) and the control liquid is complete cell culture medium (including 20% FBS and antibiotics) that was concentrated in the same way as the viral fluid (20 minute ultrafiltration spin). Information on tubes of concentrated fluid can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ip4pR0j1dJQ-rxysV2T5G4nWEk8_yAzMWNIVjh7Sfhs/edit#gid=0)

Using the [D. innubila DiNV infection protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191HoBdHh4KhIpoBTmma_ANXZZ6_2NZV3igZB3zYP5ig/edit) as the process for these infections. 

Flies emerged between 3/22 and 3/23. This means they are 5-6 days old for this infection. The day before, 6 vials were made out with 12 males and 5 females in each. Two vials of 10 males each will get the control poke, and 3 vials of 10 males each will get the DiNV poke.

Additionally, 3 flies were poked with control medium and 3 flies were poked with DiNV fluid and frozen as a day 0 sample. 

Fly mortality was measured every day for 2 weeks, and that data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SzVtZqhYgUTPPy-KPTzOHKGQpgD3OXuAcSuaoKRqAoc/edit#gid=0)

Every 3 days, flies were transferred to new food and any dead flies were frozen. At the end of the 2 weeks, all flies in the experiment were frozen. Information on frozen flies can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Usg1q_itNCL_JTjMDDJbCcpwFnhEDXTJghMi3OxwVvw/edit#gid=0)
