title: Using Middle Band Stock DiNV for Infections
---

## Infecting Male D. innubila with Middle Band DiNV to Check Titering Accuracy 

I planned on diluting the stock virus to concentrations to deliver 0.01 FFU, 0.05 FFU, 1 FFU, and 3 FFU in a 27.6nL volume to see if the mortality curves between the P4 stocK I have already done and the newly titered stocks are similar. 

I decided to use the [middle band stock that had been titered to 527,500 FFU/mL](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/01/titering-mb-p5.html). (this is also 527.5 FFU/uL) I also decided to calculate out a 3 FFU dilution and then make further dilutions from that tube. 

- For 3FFU delivery in 27.6nL solution, we'd need a 0.1086 FFU/nl solution  
- If I wanted to make 60ul of 0.1086 FFU/nl solution, we multiply 60ul * 108.6 FFU/**uL** = 6,516 FFU total needed  
- 6,516 FFU / 527.5 FFU/uL = 12.35 ul of stock MB virus  
- 60 - 12.35 = 47.65uL of cell culture medium to make the dilution 
- The other solutions were made from the 3 FFU delivery solution, these solutions were made and kept on ice until use. All solutions were pipette mixed and kept bubble free:

|tube|dilution for delivery|ul of virus solution|virus solution tube|ul of medium|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|3 FFU|12.35ul|stock tube 42|47.65ul|
|2|1 FFU|15ul|tube 1|30ul|
|3|0.1 FFU|5ul|tube 2|45ul|
|4|0.05 FFU|20ul|tube 3|20ul|
|5|0.01 FFU|5ul|tube 3|45ul|

* note that tube 3 was not used in the infections, just for further dilutions

- 11 new mushroom food vials were made 
- Males had been separated out the day prior, and were 5-7 days post emergence 
- Infections followed the [nanoinjection protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/Nanoject-Dinnubila-DiNV-Infection-Protocol.md)
