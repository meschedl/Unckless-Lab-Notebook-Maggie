title: Week of 20220110 Cell Culture Preparation - Testing Plate Types for D. innubila
---

## Using 4 Different Laying Plate Types to See What D. innubila Lays on Best

#### 20220110 Made Fresh Apple Juice Plates and Mushroom Agar Plates

- Made new apple juice agar plates, and poured them into the small petri dishes as well as the large ones
- Also made mushroom agar (Lab recipe, but used frozen mushrooms that were then autoclaved) and poured into small petri dishes
- Made fresh yeast paste and autoclaved twice

#### 20220111 Added Yeast to Plates

- Trying plain plates for both mushroom and apple juice, and also plates with a little yeast on them
- Experimental plates:

#### 20220112 Setting up Flies

- Used the 8 vials of flies that had been saved from the week before's innubila cell culture attempt
- Used 2 vials per cage, and had 4 cages set up at a time. One mushroom plate, one AJ plate, one mushroom plate with yeast, and one AJ plate with yeast
- **Did not knock out flies when adding to the cages** so some flies were lost but happiness of flies should have remained
- Noted that the mushroom plates were kind of wet

#### 20220113 Cell Culture Day 1

- Had Rob show me how to pick out eggs from the plates with a tooth pick
- Transferred flies to new plates to lay again
- Many of the flies on the mushroom plates had gotten stuck and died, mostly because the plates were too wet
- Imaged each plate to count eggs [x](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/tree/master/images/innubila-egg-laying-tests/20220113)
- Picked out eggs and put them on a yellow 100um filter
- Returned to 4012 and mostly followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html) with some modifications:
  - Used 10% FBS Schneider's medium without gentamicin or 0% FBS Schneider's medium without gentamicin made fresh that day
  - Did not use trypsin to minimize the number of washes needed to prevent loss of cells/eggs
  - Instead, I used 0% FBS medium to wash out the beach solution, 3 washes, then homogenized the eggs in 2mL of 10% medium
  - There was no waiting period after homogenization, and the homogenate was added to a flask with 3mL of 10% medium and put into the incubator at 23 degrees

#### 20220114 Cell Culture Day 2

- Transferred flies to food vials
- Imaged plates to count eggs [x](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/tree/master/images/innubila-egg-laying-tests/20220114)
- There were a lot more eggs on the mushrooom plates today, but the darkness/opaqueness of the plates made it very hard to see in the images
- Picked out eggs and put them in a beaker with some eggs wash buffer
- Returned to 4012 and mostly followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html) using the same modifications from above
- Tried to remove as much of the agar pieces or at least break them up by swishing a paintbrush on the filter while washing it with egg wash

- Imaged flasks from both days. There was a lot of debris but there was also visible cells and cell clumps!

#### 20220121 Imaging Flasks Again and Fluid Addition
- Added 1mL of 20% Schneider's medium to the 20220114 flask
- Imaged flasks, there is still debris of course, but the cells look big and still alive, some are even contracting
