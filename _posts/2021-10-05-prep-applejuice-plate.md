title:  Plate Yeast on Apple Juice Plates
---

## Prepare Apple Juice Plates with Kent (watching) 2021 10 05

**Process**
- Got apple juice plates from the 4 degree fridge in 4055
- Used autoclaved yeast from the day before
- Stirred yeast again
- Laid down a few lines of yeast so there is agar visible (see image)
- Yeast right now is too wet for the files (theyâ€™d get stuck), so they need to dry out for a day
