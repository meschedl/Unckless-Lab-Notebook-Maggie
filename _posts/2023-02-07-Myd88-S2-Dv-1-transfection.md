title: pAc5 Transfection of S2, Mys88, and Dv-1 Cells
---

## Using Mirus Bio 2020 Reagent to Transfect pAc5 GFP Expression Plasmid into S2, Dv-1, and Myd88 Cells 

Using the [TransIT 2020 Transfection Reagent](https://www.mirusbio.com/products/transfection/transit-2020-transfection-reagent) to test if I can get Myd88 cells to express GFP. This is basically a test of the transfection method on cells like might be more "primary-like." The Dv-1 and S2 cells will be controls. 

The cells were plated to 1.5*10^5 cells/mL the day before.

**pAc5 concentration**
- I concentrated the last of my plasmid extraction to 1ug/ul to use for the transfection 
- Tube 6 has 124ul of 92.7ng/ul DNA. That is total 11,494ng DNA
- I bead cleaned this extraction and eluted it in 11ul of molecular grade water, then added it to the small amount of concentrated pAc5 DNA I had previously 

**Transfection**
- All processes were done in the cell culture hood
- The DNA and transfection reagent were thawed, vortexed, spun down, and kept at room temp
- Made 3 master mix tubes with the transfection reagents:
- Tube 1 - controls 
    - 400ul Schneider's medium 
- Tube 2 - 1ul reagent per well 
    - 600ul Schneider's medium 
    - 6ul concentrated pAc5 plasmid 
    - 6ul 2020 reagent 
- Tube 3 - 3ul reagent per well 
    - 200ul Schneider's medium 
    - 2ul concentrated pAc5 plasmid
    - 2ul 2020 reagent 
- All tubes were pipette mixed gently 
- Tubes were left in the cell culture hood for 30 minutes so the liposome complexes could form 
- Then, the reagent mix was added dropwise to the appropriate well:
    - Tube 1: 100ul into wells A1, A2, A3, and A4
    - Tube 2: 102ul into wells B1, C1, B2, C2, B4, and C4
    - Tube 3: 104ul into wells B3, and C3
- The plate was gently rocked back and forth a few times to try to mix the reagent around in the wells 
- Then the plate was placed in the 23C incubator and will be checked every 24 hours 


Every ~24 hours images will be taken with the GFP filter and can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AtDpjM4MQpx62k21G-JPkzHckQoXxc73YU9puDG2FEY/edit?usp=share_link) and [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fl1CsaHwWf0IPk_LEdIxPwt17PyBe1Fg?usp=share_link)
