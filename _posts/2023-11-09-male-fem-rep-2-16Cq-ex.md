title: DNA Extraction and PCRs of Male and Female 16Cq Injection Replicate 2

## DNA Extraction and TPI/p47 PCRs of A Few Samples from Replicate 2 of the Male and Female D. innubila 16 Cq Injections 

**DNA Extractions 20231109**

I want to make sure that there was no contamination of my controls during this experiment (Taiye had some contamination in his flies and I want to make sure that this was not a result of contaminated materials that we shared). Additionally I would like to do a little more qPCR on flies who died from virus infection (we think), so I need their DNA extracted. 

These were the samples chosen for DNA extraction:

| tube | sex    | day frozen | treatment |
|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| 1    | female | day0       | CCM       |
| 2    | female | day0       | CCM       |
| 8    | male   | day0       | CCM       |
| 77   | female | day18      | CCM       |
| 78   | male   | day18      | CCM       |
| 79   | male   | day18      | CCM       |
| 22   | female | day6       | CCM       |
| 74   | female | day18      | CCM       |
| 14   | female | day0       | 16Cq DiNV |
| 15   | female | day0       | 16Cq DiNV |
| 17   | male   | day0       | 16Cq DiNV |
| 21   | male   | day3       | 16Cq DiNV |
| 88   | female | day18      | 16Cq DiNV |
| 46   | female | day9       | 16Cq DiNV |
| 47   | male   | day9       | 16Cq DiNV |
| 57   | female | day9       | 16Cq DiNV |
| 62   | male   | day10      | 16Cq DiNV |
| 65   | female | day12      | 16Cq DiNV |

DNA extraction followed [this protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/single_fly_DNA_extraction_DiNV.md) exactly. Care was taken to make sure control samples were done in first order, than the infected samples. Two extraction controls were also included in this extraction. 

**PCRs 20231110**

PCRs for TPI and p47 followed this [general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md), where I PCRd every sample including the extraction controls. A negative and positive control for each primer was run. Primer information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0)

Because of gel constraints, samples were run over 2 separate gels

TPI for all samples but the extraction controls :

p47 for almost all samples:

And the last section on this gel has the 2 extraction controls with TPI, and the remaining p47 samples:

Notably, the one female fly who did not die but got injected with DiNV did not show the virus when the experiment ended.
