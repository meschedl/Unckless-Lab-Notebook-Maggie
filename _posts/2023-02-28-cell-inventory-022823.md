## Inventory of Cell Culture and Fluid Changes, Fluid Transfers, and Passing Cells

**20230228 Inventory**

02/16 from ovaries 
- 2 flasks 
- Lots of debris in these flasks, more in one than the other 
- The pieces of the ovaries look a little intact 
- Maybe it is too soon to tell with these
- Want to fluid exchange these

02/23 from ovaries 
- 2 flasks 
- Lots of debris in the flask that had the flow through from the sieve, the other has less debris
- The pieces of the ovaries look a little intact again
- Maybe it is too soon to tell with these
- Want to fluid exchange these

02/01 and 01/31
- 2 flasks each
- Some clumps of cells have settled down on the plastic 
- Not much has grown yet, might be to early to expect much 
- Want to fluid exchange these

02/09 from 05/02
- 2 flasks 
- Precipitate is in these flasks  
- But some clumps of cells have settled, but no growth from them yet 
- Want to fluid exchange these

02/09 from 10/4 
- 2 flasks
- Not sure what is going on in these flasks, there do seem to be a lot of cells, but they don't seem to be like growing out from each other, they are spaced somewhat apart 
- Want to fluid exchange these

10/04 
- 1 flask 
- Was slightly scraped on 02/09 
- It still looks like there are tons of cells in this flask, but I'm not sure if they are dead cells/debris or growing 
- Want to try scraping up this flask and putting it into 2 new ones 

02/09 from 12/14 and 12/13
- 3 flasks 
- Doesn't look like there are any alive cells, throw out 

09/27
- 1 flask 
- Lots of alive looking clumps of cells, but many are floating
- One area has a good spot of growing out cells 
- Wanting to try to fluid change this flask, but put the fluid into something like a 12 well plate where maybe the clumps will settle better?

10/04 
- 1 flask 
- A couple of areas of good, growing out cells, but not enough yet to try to make a second passage 
- Want to fluid change this flask

12/13 
- 1 flask 
- A couple of areas of settled growing cells 
- Lots of clumps that are floating 
- Want to try putting fluid from this flask into a 12 well plate 

08/18 
- 1 flask 
- Basically seems like nothing is alive in this flask 
- Thrown out 

12/14
- 1 flask 
- Lots of clumps of cells that aren't settled 
- Want to try putting fluid from this flask into a 12 well plate 

08/11 
- 2 flasks 
- All cells seem to be dead 
- Thrown out

09/20
- 2 flasks 
- 1 flask has a nice area of growing out cells 
- Want to fluid change that flask 
- The other flask doesn't have anything growing or alive looking, this flask was thrown out

01/18 from 09/13 
- 2 flasks 
- 1 flask has an area of growing out cells 
- Want to fluid change that flask 
- The other flask doesn't have anything alive in it, thrown out 
- The original 09/13 flask doesn't really look like anything is alive in it anymore but I'll keep it for a bit longer and fluid change it

01/12
- 2 flasks 
- 1 flask looks really great with lots of areas of growing stringy cells
- This flask I want to scrape and make a second passage
- The other flask does not have that much growth but seems ok 
- This flask with just get a fluid change

- Basically it doesn't seem like any cells are alive 
- Thrown out 

02/09
- 1 flask 
- Cells seem alive, but they just haven't settled to the bottom of the flask 
- Want to try putting fluid from this flask into a 12 well plate 

09/27
- 1 flask 
- Some nice areas of growing out cells
- A lot of floating cells too 
- Want to try putting fluid from this flask into a 12 well plate 

01/14 and 01/25 
- 2 flasks each 
- Not a lot of clumps of cells, but it might be to early to tell on these

**20230308 Fluid Changes and Re-flasking**

- For all flasks, 2mL was removed, and 2mL was added 
- 02/01 2 flasks 
- 01/31 2 flasks

- 01/24 2 flasks 
- 01/25 2 flasks 

Flasks to fluid change and put the fluid in a 12 well plate 
- 1.5mL of the flask fluid was put into the intereior wells of a 12 well plate 
- Then .5mL of fresh fluid was added to that well 
- 2mL of new fluid was added back into the old flask 
- 09/27 1 flask

- 10/04
    - This flask was lightly scraped, then 2mL of fluid was split into 2 new flasks, each with 6mL of fresh fluid 
- 01/12
    - This flask was lightly scraped, and 2mL of the fluid was put into 1 flask with 6mL of new fluid total 
- The original flasks were given 2mL of fresh fluid and kept
