title: Injecting Flies with DiNV for Kent and Gut Dissection 
---

## Injecting Male and Female D. innubila with DiNV for Kent and Gut Dissection 

- Flies had emerged on 3/23 and 3/24 and are 5-6 days old 
- All flies got undiluted P4 DiNV 
- 7 new vials of food were made
- Used virus aliquot 34 
- Infection followed exactly the [nanoinjection protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/Nanoject-Dinnubila-DiNV-Infection-Protocol.md)
- Fly mortality was not monitored because they were taken for timepoint dissections
