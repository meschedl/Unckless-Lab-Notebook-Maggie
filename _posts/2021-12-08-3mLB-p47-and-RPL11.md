title: 3mLB-120hr Zymo Gel Extractioned DNA PCR with RPL11 and p47
---

## RPL11 and p47 PCR on Gel Extraction Products from [Second Zymoclean Gel Extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/12/07/HMW-Gel-and-Zymo-Ex-2.html) to Check for DiNV in HMW Chunk

**20211208 p47 PCR**
- Samples to PCR: 3mLB-150, 3mLB-UPPER, 3mLB-LOWER, and a positive and negative control
- For DNA amounts: the quants from the gel extraction were a little variable, so I decided to leave room for 3ul of DNA, and add water for the samples that had more DNA
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 1ul 10X NEB buffer * 5.5 = 5.5ul
  - 1ul 2mM dNTPs * 5.5 = 5.5ul
  - 1ul 25mM MgCl2 * 5.5 = 5.5ul
  - 0.25ul p47_F * 5.5 = 1.375ul
  - 0.25ul p47_R * 5.5 = 1.375ul
  - 0.1ul NEB taq * 5.5 = 0.55ul
  - 3.4ul molecular grade water * 5.5 = 18.7ul

|tube # |sample|ul master mix|ul DNA|ul molec grade water|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|3mLB-150|7|1|2|
|2|3mLB-UPPER|7|3|0|
|3|3mLB-LOWER|7|2|1|
|3|neg control|7|0|3|
|4|pos control|7|1|2|

- Vortexed and spun down and put in the PCR program for p47
  - 94 degrees C 5 minutes
  - **94 degrees C 45 seconds**
  - **55 degrees C 1 minute**
  - **68 degrees C 1.5 minutes**
  - 68 degrees C 5 minutes
  - Hold at 12 degrees C
  - _bold text is cycled through 30 times_
- After, tubes were put in the fridge for overnight until a gel could be run

**20211208 RPL11 PCR**
- Using same samples and DNA additions as with p47 above
- Created master mix on ice:
  - 1ul 10X NEB taq buffer * 5.50 = 5.5ul
  - 1ul 2mM dNTPs * 5.5 = 5.5ul
  - 1ul 25mM MgCl2 * 5.5 =5.5ul
  - 0.25ul 10uM vir_RPL11_F primer * 5.5 = 1.375ul
  - 0.25ul 10uM vir_RPL11_R primer * 5.5 = 1.375ul
  - 0.1ul NEB Taq * 5.5ul = 0.55ul
  - 3.4ul molecular grade water * 5.5 = 18.7ul

- Vortexed and spun down and placed in PCR program RPL11:
  - 95 degrees C 3 minutes
  - **95 degrees C 30 seconds**
  - **57 degrees C 1 minute**
  - **68 degrees C 1 minute 30 seconds**
  - 68 degrees C 5 minutes
  - 12 degree C hold
  - _bold sections are cycled 34 times_
- After, tubes were put in the fridge overnight until the gel
