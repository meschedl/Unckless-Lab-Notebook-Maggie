title: DNA Extractions from Concentrated Viral Fluid
--- 

## Extracting DNA from Ultrafiltered Viral Fluids 

To do qPCR on the concentrated, non-concentrated, flow through, and wash samples from the [test viral fluid concentration](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/02/22/Viral-fluid-concentration-test.html) I need to have DNA extracted. I used the 50ul aliquots from those samples, and left the others frozen. See sample list below. I also extracted DNA from 1 40ul aliquot of D. innubila supernatant that I got from Kent that is "day 26" from way earlier in the experiment (not listed on the table). 

I followed the same extraction procedure as any other cell culture supernatant sample ([like this one](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/02/14/dna-extracts-02-14-23.html)).

- All samples were thawed on ice
- Lysis solution was chilled on ice until opaque 
- Added 1ul of 1000:1 diluted lambda DNA to each sample tube
- Using the Qiagen Puregene Blood and Tissue reagents/method
- Turned on the heat blocks to 65C and 37C 
- Added 250ul of chilled cell lysis solution to each tube and pipette mixed 10X
- Incubated tubes in the heat block at 65C for 10 minutes
- Diluted RNase A. We have a 10mg/mL stock now, and I did some looking around in our protocols and it seems like we want 2mg/mL per 150ul of liquid. So because I am using 300ul of liquid here, I wanted to use 4mg/mL per sample. I am still not sure if I was doing this calculation correctly 
    - 4ul RNase A 10mg/mL
    - 6ul nuclease free water 
    - Pipette mixed
- Let tubes come to room temp after the heat block
- Added 1ul of the diluted RNase A to each tube
- Flipped the tubes 25X to mix them
- Incubated tubes at 37C for 30 minutes in the heat block
- Let tubes come to room temp after incubation
- Added 100ul of protein precipitation solution to each tube
- Vortexed tubes ~10 sec
- Placed tubes on ice for 5 min
- Centrifuged tubes 16,300g for 3 minutes 
- Made new tubes with 300ul of fresh 100% isopropanol with final tube labels
- Transferred the supernatant from the centrifugation (~400ul) to the new tubes with the isopropanol
- Inverted the tubes 50X
- Centrifuged the tubes 16,300g for 5 minutes 
- Discarded the supernatant
    - Note that I didnâ€™t see a pellet in any of the samples
- Added 300ul of fresh 70% ethanol to each tube
- Inverted 3X
- Centrifuged tubes 16,300g 5 min 
- Discarded supernatant
- Let tubes air dry upside down on a kim wipe for ~1 hour
- Resuspended DNA in 20ul of DNA hydration solution and let tubes sit overnight
- Tubes were put in the -20 the next day
