title: Testing p47 PCR on Gel Extraction Samples in 3 Reaction Conditions
---

## Testing Diluted DNA 10ul Reaction Volume, 20ul Reaction Volume, and Diluted DNA in 20ul Reaction Volume for "3mLB" Gel Extractions on p47 PCR (for DiNV detection)

**20211220 20ul Reaction PCRs**
- Made up a master mix for all the 20ul reaction volume reactions:
  - 2ul NEB buffer * 15.5 = 31ul
  - 2ul dNTPs * 15.5 = 31ul
  - 2ul MgCL2 * 15.5 = 31ul
  - 0.5ul p47_F * 15.5 = 7.75ul
  - 0.5ul p47_R * 15.5 = 7.375ul
  - 0.2ul NEB Taq * 15.5 = 3.1ul
  - 9.9ul water * 15.5 = 151.9ul
- Kept master mix on ice
- Set up 13 strip tubes for the PCRs, tried using samples from the 1st attempt Zymo gel extraction, and the second attempt Zymo gel extraction (B)
- Added the appropriate amount of master mix, sample, and water to each tube:

|tube #|sample|ul master mix|ul DNA|ul water|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|3mL-150|17|3|0|
|2|3mL-UP|17|3|0|
|3|3mL-LOW|17|3|0|
|4|3mLB-150|17|1|2|
|5|3mLB-LOW|17|2|1|
|6|3mL-150-D|17|3|0|
|7|3mL-UP-D|17|3|0|
|8|3mL-LOW-D|17|3|0|
|9|3mLB-150-D|17|1|2|
|10|3mLB-UP-D|17|3|0|
|11|3mLB-LOW-D|17|2|1|
|12|neg control|17|0|3|
|13|pos control|17|1|2|

- Vortexed and spun down and put in the PCR program for p47
  - 95 degrees C 5 minutes
  - **95 degrees C 30 seconds**
  - **55 degrees C 30 seconds**
  - **68 degrees C 30 seconds**
  - 68 degrees C 5 minutes
  - Hold at 12 degrees C
  - _bold text is cycled through 30 times_
- After, tubes were put in the fridge for overnight until a gel could be run

**20211221 Gel of 20ul Reactions**
- Ran all samples on a 2% gel for 30 minutes at 90V
- All samples except the positive control had no amplification...

**20220103 Diluted DNA 10ul Reaction PCR**
- Made up a master mix for 10ul reactions, only using the "B" diluted samples, and using the 3mL HMW DNA as a second positive control
  - 1ul NEB buffer * 6.6 = 6.6ul
  - 1ul dNTPs * 6.6 = 6.6ul
  - 1ul MgCL2 * 6.6 = 6.6ul
  - 0.25ul p47_F * 6.6 = 1.65ul
  - 0.25 p47_R * 6.6 = 1.65ul
  - 0.1ul NEB Taq * 6.6 = 0.66ul (not this was Taq that had been left out at some point)
  - 4.4ul water * 6.6 = 29.04ul
- Kept master mix on ice
- Added mix, DNA, and water to strip tubes:

|tube #|sample|ul master mix|ul DNA|ul water|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|3mLB-150-D|8|1|1|
|2|3mLB-UP-D|8|2|0|
|3|3mLB-LOW-D|8|2|0|
|4|3mL HMW|8|1|1|
|5|neg control|8|0|2|
|6|pos control|8|1|1|

- Vortexed and spun down and put in the PCR program for p47
  - 95 degrees C 5 minutes
  - **95 degrees C 30 seconds**
  - **55 degrees C 30 seconds**
  - **68 degrees C 30 seconds**
  - 68 degrees C 5 minutes
  - Hold at 12 degrees C
  - _bold text is cycled through 30 times_
- A 2% gel was made the same day, and the samples were run for 30 minutes at 90V, again: the only amplifications are the two positive cintriks
