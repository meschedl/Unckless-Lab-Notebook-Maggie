title: Another Hirt DNA Extraction and Exonuclease Treatment For DiNV DNA
---

## Using the Hirt Method and Exonuclease Treatment To Get DiNV DNA for Electroporation 

**Prep samples** 

- 2 flasks of DiNV were infected on 1/30 with passage 4 DiNV 
- In the hood, ~5ul of medium was removed from each flask and frozen in a 15mL conical 
- The remaining fluid from the flasks was scraped and aliquoited into 6 tubes, each with ~800ul of fluid: 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 
- The samples were spun down at 2000g for 3 minutes
- The supernatant was removed and put in the 15mL conical and frozen 
- The cell pellets proceeded with the extraction: 

**Lysis and Chromosomal DNA Precipitation**

- The small centrifuge was placed in the 4C at least an hour before use
- All processes were done in the fume hood
- Added 147ul 50mM Tris HCl, 10mM EDTA to all the samples
- Prepared 5mg/mL RNase A
    - 10ul molecular grade water 
    - 10ul 10mg/mL RNase A
    - Vortexed and spun down to mix
- Added 3ul of 5mg/mL RNase A to each sample
- Added 150ul of 1.2% SDS to each tube
- Inverted tubes, gently resuspended pellet with clipped pipette tips to mix 
- Incubated tubes on bench for ~20 minutes to lyse/digest all cells/virus
    - This seemed to work, periodically inverted the samples throughout that time
- Precipitated chromosomal DNA and cellular debris by added 210ul of 3M CsCl, 1M potassium acetate, 0.67M acetic acid
  - A white precipitate immediately started forming in the tubes, I pipette mixed the solution with clipped pipette tips
- Immediately placed tubes on ice for 30 minutes incubation 
- Centrifuged tubes for 15 minutes at 16,000rcf at 4 degrees C (I did not do a second centrifuge because it always seemed unnecessary)
- During this time I made fresh 80% and 100% ethanol and put them in the -20 freezer to cool
- Moved supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes 
    - 26: 485ul
    - 27: 485ul
    - 28: 485ul
    - 29: 485ul
    - 30: 485ul
    - 31: 485ul

Phenol Chloroform Extraction

- Still in the fume hood
- Added equal volume of cold phenol-chlorofomr-isoamy-alcohol to the tubes (Note!! phenol-chloroform-isoamy-alcohol is in two phases, I think you are supposed to use the bottom layer for this, see [x](https://hermanlab.unl.edu/protocols/phenolppt.html))
    - 26: 485ul
    - 27: 485ul
    - 28: 485ul
    - 29: 485ul
    - 30: 485ul
    - 31: 485ul 
- Mixed tubes up and down and then put them on an orbital mixer in the hood for 10 minutes, the samples did become cloudy at this time
- Centrifuged tubes at 16,000rcf at room temp for 15 minutes
- Looked for phase separation
  - Phase separation looked great, there were two distinct layers in each tube, there was a small white layer between the two phases
- Transferred top aqueous phase to new final labeled tubes (did not use clipped tips here for better pipetting )
    - I did not try to get absolutely everything, I did not want to suck up both phases
    - 26: 475ul
    - 27: 480ul
    - 28: 445ul
    - 29: 445ul
    - 30: 445ul
    - 31: 445ul
- Added 0.1X tube liquid volume of new 3M NaOAc to each tube
    - 26: 47.5ul
    - 27: 48ul
    - 28: 44.5ul
    - 29: 44.5ul
    - 30: 44.5ul
    - 31: 44.5ul
- Added 1000ul of cold 100% ethanol to each tube
- Inverted tubes to mix
- Placed tubes in the -20 overnight

**20240303 DNA Precipitation**

- Took tubes out of the freezer and centrifuged tubes at max speed at 4C for 30 minutes
  - Tubes had not frozen in the freezer
  - Each tube looked like they had a pellet that was pretty visible
- Pipetted off supernatant into a waste container
- Added 500ul of cold fresh 80% ethanol and inverted twice to mix
- Centrifuged tubes at max speed at 4C for 30 minutes
- Pipetted off supernatant into a waste container
- Let tubes dry ~30 minutes upside-down on the bench
- Resuspended pellets in 20ul of 10mM tris HCl and left on the bench a few hours before qubiting 
- Qubit followed [this protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCz0SBof6LHE3P_LbftawFyexl8iCECUlvjIcauPYwY/edit) for broad range reagents 
    - 26: 90.3ng/ul 
    - 27: 105ng/ul
    - 28: 27.4ng/ul

**20240303 Exonuclease Treatment**

- Kept DNA on ice, flicked to mix and spun down 
- Want to do 1ug for each sample if possible, sample 31 had so much DNA I did 3 sets from it
- Prepared samples in 1.5mL tubes 

|sample|DNA vol|10mM tris vol|total DNA|
|---|---|---|---|
|26|11ul|19ul|1000ng|
|27|9.5ul|20.5ul|1000ng|
|28|14.5ul|15.5ul|400ng|

|31-B|3.5ul|26.5ul|1000ng|
|31-C|3.5ul|26.5ul|1000ng|

- Thawed NEBuffer 4 and ATP on ice, vortexed and spun down 
- Exo V enzyme kept on ice 
- To each tube added:
    - 4ul NEBuffer 4
    - 4ul ATP
    - 2ul exonuclease V 
- Tubes were flicked to mix and spun down 
- Placed tubes at 37C heat block for 1 hour 
- Warmed other heat block to 70C 
- After the 1 hour, the samples were transferred to a pre-warmed tube rack in the 70C heat block for 30 min 

**Phenol Chloroform Cleanup**

I want these samples after the cleanup to be more concentrated, so I decided to pool the samples into only 2 samples 

- Combined samples 26, 27, 28, and 29 together into 1 1.5mL tube with clipped pipette tips - sample 26-exo
- Combined samples 30, 31-A, 31-B, and 31-C together into 1 1.5mL tube with clipped pipette tips - sample 30-exo
- Added 140ul of 10mM tris HCL to each tube to bring the volumes up to 300ul 
- Further processes were done in the hood 
- Added equal volume (~300ul) of cold phenol-chloroform isoamy alcohol
- Inverted to mix
- Placed tube on orbital shaker for 10 minutes 
- Centrifuged tube for 15 minutes at 16,000rcf at room temp 
- Removed the top layer into new final labeled tubes:
    - 20: 305ul
    - 22: 305ul
- Added 0.1X volume of 3M sodium acetate to the tube 
    - 20: 30.5ul
    - 22: 30.5ul
- Added 2-2.5X volume of cold 100% ethanol to the tube: I added 750ul which is 2.5X
- Mixed by inverting many times 
- Placed sample in the -20 overnight 
- Placed the centrifuge in the 4C to cool overnight

**20240304 Finish Cleanup**

- Centrifuged tube at 4C for 30 minutes at 16,000rcf 
    - I did see a pellet in both tubes
- Pipetted off the supernatant into the waste 
- Added 500ul of cold fresh 80% ethanol 
- Inverted the tube twice 
- Centrifuged the tube at 4C for 30 minutes at 16,000rcf 
- Pipetted off the supernatant into the waste 
- Let the tube dry for ~15 minutes upside down 
- Resuspended the pellets in 25ul of 10mM tris 
- Let pellet resuspend for a few hours before qubiting 
- Qubit followed [this protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCz0SBof6LHE3P_LbftawFyexl8iCECUlvjIcauPYwY/edit) for high sensitivity reagents 
    - 20: 15.1ng/ul
