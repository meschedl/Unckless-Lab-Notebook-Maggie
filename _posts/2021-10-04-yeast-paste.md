Making Yeast Paste with Kent (watching) 2021 10 04

Notes

- This process makes 2 weeks worth (enough for 4 plates)
- Make sure autoclave is free before starting, don&#39;t want yeast to sit wet for too long before being killed
- These are not exact calculations/measurements

Process

- Used small autoclaved beaker \&gt; in shelf above Kent&#39;s bench
- Used yeast from cell culture fridge
- Poured out to slightly above the 20mL mark in the beaker with the yeast, also can use the scraper/scooper tool on the bench
- Added 15-20mL of molecular grade water to the beaker with a 5mL serological pipette and the automatic aspirator
- Stirred the mix with the flat side of the scraper tool \&gt; no chunks
- Yeast turned into thick-ish paste, sort of like stiff frosting
- Get apple juice from the cell culture fridge
- Added small amount of juice to the yeast paste (maybe 1-2mL)
- Stirred paste again \&gt; looking for royal icing/cookie icing consistency. Want it to fall from the tool in ribbons and have the ribbons visible in the beaker. Can add more yeast here if needed
- Covered lid with foil and autoclave tape
- Used autoclave bin on the cart in 4012
- Put in info on the autoclave signup sheet
- Put yeast in the tray into the machine
- Closed the wheel door until the button on the machine said sealed
- Used cycle 3 (liquid)
- Runs for ~50 min
- Door was unsealed when done \&gt; wheeled back the door and slowly opened. Used autoclave gloves to remove the tray
