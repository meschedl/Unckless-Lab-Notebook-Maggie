title: More Test innubila and D. melanogaster Infections with Serratia
---

## More training on Infections with Serratia on _D. innubila_ and _D. innubila_

My previous attempt at infections was not completely informational based on the mortality. I could have either poked too lightly or that innubila are more resistant to serratia infections - both could be true. This time I am trying different ODs of serratia, and also adding melanogaster flies.

I had previously separated out 8 vials of innubila, each with 22 males and 10 females. These had aged 7-10 days in the incubator. There was some loss of fly life with these.
Melanogaster flies from Kistie were a little older, probably 12-14 days but they would do for a test.

#### 20220904 Making Sugar Agar Vials and Growing Serratia Overnight

**Sugar Agar**
- Made up 30 vials
- Recipe:
  - 33.2g sugar
  - 8g drosophila agar
  - 400mL DI water
- Combined these into a 1L flask and microwaved until boiling
  - This was basically impossible to not boil over
- When it had boiled and was clear, let sit on the counter until it was 60C
- Measured 0.8g tegosept and dissolved it in 95% ethanol
- At 60C, added the tegosept and mixed on the stir plate
- Used serological pipettes to add 10mL of sugar agar to each vial
  - There was a little left over
- Covered the vials in a pillow case and let cure overnight
- Next day stored in the fridge with press-n-seal covering

**Growing Serratia**
- Using the Unkless lab strain # 93
- Made up 3 liquid culture LB tubes
- Picked 1 colony from the plate and put into the culture tubes
- Placed in the 37C incubator overnight

#### 20220905 Infections

**Spectrophotometer**
- Let bulb warm up for 10 minutes before use
- Plan was to make 0.1, 1, and 4 ODs
- I titrated drops of culture and LB, and used a concentrated bacterial culture to get the correct OD readings. This took me about 30 minutes. I felt like I was running short on time so I ended up not making an OD of 4, but just getting it to ~3 and using that one
- Exact ODs were: 0.099, 1.004, and 3.153
- Each one was pipetted into a 0.6mL tube, and an LB tube was made as well
- Test tubes were bleached and the area was cleaned with 70% ethanol

**Serratia Infections**
- Plan was to do 30 LB innubila, 40 0.1 OD innubila, 40 1 OD innubila, and 40 3 OD innubila. I also got some melanogaster c564 flies from Kistie to also try infecting. I wanted to do 20 LB dmel, 20 0.1 OD dmel, and 20 1 OD dmel
- Process for infecting flies:
  - Got a new tube of 95% ethanol
  - Cleaned a probe and an infection needle
  - Prepared/labeled 2 sugar agar vials per vial of innubila or 2 molasses vials per vial of c564
  - Dumped the fly vial on the C02 and recorded the time on the vial
  - Sexed flies and split number of males in half. Half would get 1 treatment, and the other half would get a different one. The order of what treatment/poke they got I varied throughout
  - I infected half the flies, dipping the needle in the infection liquid after each fly, then put the flies in their new vial, then disinfected the probe and the needle. Then I moved on to the other half of the flies
  - I tried hard this time to be more consistent with my poking, and I tried to poke more below the wing joint which is softer
- Set up for innubila:
