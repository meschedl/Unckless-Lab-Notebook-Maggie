title: 2nd Replicate 16Cq innubila Infections for Freezing Experiment 
---

## Second Infection of D. innubila with 16Cq DiNV For Freezing for Viral Load on Day 0, Day 3, Day 5, and Day 10

This the second replicare experiment to get at what percentage of flies are infected at what stage during the infection. The plan is to freeze infected flies at day 0, day 3, day 5, and day 10 after being poked. I can then do PCR to test how many were infected, and do qPCR down the line if results look interesting to look at viral load. For this I am using males and females to see their potential differences. 

For males and females I planned to use:
- 10 flies infected with DiNV for day 0, 6 sterile poke flies for day 0 
- 20 flies infected with DiNV for day 3, 6 sterile poke flies for day 3
- 20 flies infected with DiNV for day 5, 6 sterile poke flies for day 5
- 20 flies infected with DiNV for day 10, 6 sterile poke flies for day 10

Flies were separated out into vials of ~7 or ~11 individuals the day before on the 5thnd so they would be easier to sex and count during infections. 

All sterile poke flies were done first to avoid any possible contamination issues. The 16Cq fluid was thawed on ice and kept on ice for the duration of the infections.
