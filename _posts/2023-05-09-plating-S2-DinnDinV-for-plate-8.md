title: Plating S2 and Re-plating 3.1 DinnDiNV Cells for Transfection
---

## Counting and Plating S2 Cells and Adding 3.1 Cells to Plate 8 For Transfection 

I left the 3.1 and 3.0 DinnDiNV cells that I tried my best to de-clump and plated in the [12 well plate on 4/27](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/04/27/Checking-Cells-and-Cell-Work-04-27.html) for over a week, and two columns (the 3.0 cells that were scraped) just had not grown very much. I thought that there had just been too few clumps of cells to start growing out properly in those wells. 

Plate layout:

The 3.1 cell fluid wells have a lot more growth, so I decided to keep those wells the same. I had 3.1 top of filter cells from 4/27 that had been growing in a flask since then, that I decided to trypsinize and add to the wells that hadn't been doing good. 

**Adding more DinnDiNV cells**
- Poured off the medium from the 4/27 3.1 flask 
- Added 3mL trypsin, rinsed, and poured off
- Added 5mL trypsin and waited ~5 minutes until all the cells had come off the bottom of the flask 
- Took the fluid and put it into a 15mL tube 
- Centrifuged the tube for 2 minutes at 200rpm 
- Removed all the supernatant from the pellet of cells 
- Resuspended the cells in 6mL 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom 
- Ran those 6mL through a 70um cell strainer 
- Resuspended the top of the filter captured cells in 5mL of 20% FBS Schneider's medium with 4% mushroom and plated that in a new flask for passage 3 of those cells
- The 6mL that had passed through the 70um filter was distributed throughout the center 6 wells on plate 8, columns 2 and 3 

**Counting and plating S2 cells**
- I decided to plate the S2 at a slightly lower number than I have done previously, 100,000 cells per mL instead of 150,000 cells per mL, because I am not able to count the DinnDiNV cells and I guess that there are less of them 
- Took an old flask of cells and removed 3mL from the fluid (many cells in the supernatant) and put it in a 15mL tube
- Added 3mL 10% FBS Schneider's medium to the tube and mixed 
- Took 20ul from the cell fluid in the tube and put it in a hemocytometer to count the number of cells:

|section|quadrant 1|quadrant 2| quadrant 3| quadrant 4|section average|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|128|118|102|107|114|
|2|117|103|91|102|103|

- Each section was averaged, and the average of the two sections was taken
  - Total S2 average: 109
- The cells per mL is the average * 10^4
  - 109 * 10^4 = 1,090,000 cells per mL 
- (1.09*10^6 cells/mL)(5mL) = (100,000 cell/mL)(xmL)
    - x = 65.4mL medium
- Because I only want 6mL, I divided the xmL and the cell volume 6mL by 10
    - 6.54mL 10% FBS medium 
    - 0.6mL cell resuspention 
- This was made, and 1.5mL S2 cell suspension was put in wells A1, B1, C1, and A3

The plate was put in the incubator to grow overnight
