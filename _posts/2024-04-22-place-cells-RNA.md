title: Plating Dinn-1 Cells for RNA

## Plating Dinn-1 Cells for Infection then RNA 

I planned to do these in 24 well plates, and have 1 plate per day that needs to be frozen so I don't need to disturb plates that are not being used on certain days. 

- Each well needs ~1mL of cells and fluid 
- I cell scraped a flask of Dinn-1 cells 
- Pelleted the cells and removed the supernatant 
- Resuspended the cells in 30mL of fresh medium 
- Added 1mL of cell solution to each well in the planned 24 well plates 
- These plates were put in the incubator until infection so they could grow out 
- Outer wells were filled with water to prevent evaporation
