## Inoculating Dinn-1 and Dv-1 Cells with DiNV for DiNV Growth qPCR 

Cells were [plated previously](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/20/plate-dinn-cell-infec.html), and are in this layout in 2 different 24 well plates: 

|   | 1       | 2       | 3         | 4         | 5 | 6 |
|---|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|---|---|
| A | Dv-1 CC | Dinn CC | Dv-1 DiNV | Dinn DiNV |   |   |
| B | Dv-1 CC | Dinn CC | Dv-1 DiNV | Dinn DiNV |   |   |
| C | Dv-1 CC | Dinn CC | Dv-1 DiNV | Dinn DiNV |   |   |
| D | Dv-1 CC | Dinn CC | Dv-1 DiNV | Dinn DiNV |   |   |

- Similar to the [Myd88 experiment](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/03/17/innoc-myd88-cells.html), I wanted to add 10ul of passage 4 virus to each well that gets infected, but I wanted the volume added to be larger to mix more
- So I diluted 170ul of P4 DiNV with 255ul of medium
- Then added 25ul of that solution to each virus well
- And 25ul of straight medium to the control wells
- Rocked the plates back and forth a bit
- ay 0 plate was placed in the -80 immediately
- The day 5 plate was placed in the 23C incubator for 5 days, when it was also placed in the -80
