# Another Attempt With the Genomic Tip [Blood & Cell Culture DNA Midi Kit](https://www.qiagen.com/sg/shop/pcr/blood-and-cell-culture-dna-midi-kit/) on One Cell Control and One DiNV Positive Cell Culture Samples

**Notes**
- Samples:
  - Pos-B: DiNV GS 2.1 FH 240hr Flask 7-18-2018
  - CC-B: DiNV GS 3 240hr CC Flask 7-18-2018
- Using 600ul input this time to try to increase yield of DNA
- Going to let the pellet dry for longer (30 min if possible) after the ethanol wash because in the regular extraction protocol they let their pellets dry out for a lot longer. Apparently ethanol can inhibit DNA from going into solution
- Going to leave the samples resuspending for an extra day before trying the QC
- Samples were left overnight in the fridge to avoid a freeze thaw cycle
- Trying a new centrifuge this time for the precipitation that goes closer to 5000g

**Washing Cells**
- Made fresh 70% ethanol and placed in the fridge
- Placed 1X PBS and molec grade water on ice
- Kept samples on ice
- Set centrifuge on the 5th floor to go to 4 degrees
- Inverted sample tubes before pipetting to mix up the cells
- Clipped the ends of p1000 pipette tips for each sample
- Transferred 600ul of each sample into their own 15mL tube
- Added 9mL cold PBS to each tube
- Centrifuged tubes at 1,500rcf for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C
- Removed supernatant from each tube without disturbing the pellet
  - There was a visible small pellet in each tube
- Added 10mL cold PBS to each tube
- Centrifuged tubes at 1,500rcf for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C
- Removed supernatant
- Added 2mL cold PBS to each tube
- Added 2mL cold buffer C1 to each tube
- Added 6mL cold molecular grade water to each tube
- Vortexed to get the pellet to resuspend  
- Let tubes sit on ice for 10 minutes
- Centrifuged 1,300rcf for 15 minutes at 4 degrees C
- Removed supernatant without disturbing the pellet
  - There is a small pellet in each sample
- Added 1mL cold buffer C1 to each tube
- Added 3mL cold molecular grade water to each tube
- Vortexed breifly
- Centrifuged 1,300rcf for 15 minutes at 4 degrees C
- Removed supernatant

**Incubation**
- Added 5mL buffer G2 to each tube
- Added 95mL proteinase K to each tube
- Vortexed tubes briefly
  - I did see the pellet come up again and hopefully get fully mixed
- Placed tubes in the incubator at 50 degrees C for ~60 minutes

**Genomic Tip Extraction**
- Set up two tips over 50mL conicals
- Added 4mL buffer GBT to each tip and let drip
  - Note here that the tip for the POS-B sample drips a lot slower than the one for the CC-B sample, I had significant wait times with just that tip
- Vortexed sample tubes briefly
- Cut p1000 tips for each samples
- Added total volume (~5mL) of each sample to their respective tips and let drip
- Placed buffer QF in the incubator to warm to 50 degrees C
- Added 7.5mL of buffer QC to each tip
- Transferred tips to a new 15mL waste conical
- Added 7.5mL of buffer QC to each tip
- Transferred tips to new 15mL conicals labeled for final tubes
- Added 5mL of warmed buffer QF to each tip

**Precipitation**
- Added 3.5mL of 100% isopropanol to each elutent tube and inverted multiple times to mix
- Centrifuged tubes in the Slusky Lab at 4 degrees C 4,816rcf for 30 min
**After this centrifugation, both conicals had completely cracked and broken. Sample liquid was not salvageable. Extraction attempt was stopped here. The tubes I had used were polystyrene not polypropylene which means they couldn't stand very much force. I will need to try this extraction again with a new set of tubes, and I will have to ask Kent for more samples.**
