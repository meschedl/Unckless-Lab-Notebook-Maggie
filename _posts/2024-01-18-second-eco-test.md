## Second Exonuclease V Treatment Test on Hirt Extracts to Attemp to Remove Linear DNA and 6 Hour Gel 

Because the [gel of the previous treatment test](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/01/17/exo-treatment-gel.html) was really hard to see for one of the crucial samples, I decided to try the treatment and cleanups again on just the cell pellet samples. Sample information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19HplN9TvH7pDqtDkWpclmwUZHeBB1PwhQunieT6FHSo/edit#gid=0)

**20240118 Exonuclease Treatment**

- Followed exact same process as the [first use](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/01/11/exonuclease-treatment-test.html), where the protocol was based off of [this protocol](https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2017/11/28/removal-of-residual-gdna-after-purification-of-low-copy-plasmid-using-exonuclease-v-recbcd)
- I used the rest of the DNA in the 16 and 17 samples to try to maximize what I could 

|sample|DNA|10mM Tris to 30ul|total DNA|
|---|---|---|---|
|16|16ul|14ul|~900ng|
|17|16ul|14ul|~900ng|

- All DNA was kept on ice, flicked to mix, and spun down before use 
- All reagents were thawed on ice, vortexed to mix, and spun down before use 
- The enzyme was not frozen, and was spun down before use 
- DNA was diluted into 1.5mL tubes 
- To each diluted sample tube:
    - Added 4ul of NEBuffer 4
    - Added 4ul of ATP
    - Added 2ul of exonuclease V 
- Tubes were flicked to mix and spun down 
- Tubes were placed in the 37C heat block for 1 hour 
- Then tubes were placed in a 70C heat block for 30 minutes to inactivate the enzyme 
- Samples were kept on ice while awaiting cleanup

I still wanted to see if there was a difference in size retained from the NEB Monarch cleanup or a phenol chloroform cleanup, so I tried both. 

**NEB Monarch DNA Cleanup**

- Using sample 17 for this 
- Using [NEB Monarch PCR and DNA kit protocol](https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2015/11/23/monarch-pcr-and-dna-cleanup-kit-protocol)
- Warmed DNA elution buffer to 50C in heatblock
- Increased the volume in the tube from 40ul to 200ul with 160ul of 10mM tris 
- Added a 2:1 ratio of DNA binding buffer to the tube: 400ul each 
- Inverted tube to mix and spun down 
- Added the total volume (~600) of sample to a spin column 
- Centrifuged the column at 16,000rcf for 1 minute
- Discarded the flow through 
- Added 200ul DNA wash buffer to the column
- Centrifuged the column at 16,000rcf for 1 minute
- Discarded the flow through
- Added another 200ul DNA wash buffer to the column
- Centrifuged the column at 16,000rcf for 1 minute
- Discarded the flow through
- Centrifuged the column at 16,000rcf for 1 minute "dry"
- Transferred the column to new labeled 1.5mL tubes
- Added 15ul of warmed DNA elution buffer to the center of the filter and waited 2 minutes 
- Centrifuged the column at 16,000rcf for 1 minute
- Placed the sample in the 4C for storage 

**Phenol-Chloroform Cleanup**

- Using sample 16
- Basing protocol off of what I've done in the hirt extractions ([see example](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/01/10/week-15-exp-evo-sample.html) and this [document](https://www.mhh.de/fileadmin/mhh/genomics/download/methods/Genomics_Phenol-Chloroform-Extraction.pdf))
- All work was done in the fume hood
- Increased volume in sample to 300ul with 260ul of 10mM tris 
- Added equal volume (~300ul) of cold phenol-chloroform isoamy alcohol
- Inverted to mix
- Placed tube on orbital shaker for 10 minutes 
- Centrifuged tube for 15 minutes at 16,000rcf at room temp 
- Removed the top layer into new final labeled tubes:
    - 16: 300ul  
- Added 0.1X volume (30ul) of 3M sodium acetate to the tube 
- Added 2-2.5X volume of cold 100% ethanol to the tube: I added 750ul which is 2.5X
- Mixed by inverting many times 
- Placed sample in the -20 overnight 
- Placed the centrifuge in the 4C to cool overnight
- Next day 20240118  
- Centrifuged tube at 4C for 30 minutes at 16,000rcf 
    - I did saw a very small pellet
- Poured off the supernatant into the waste 
- Added 500ul of cold fresh 80% ethanol 
- Inverted the tube twice 
- Centrifuged the tube at 4C for 30 minutes at 16,000rcf 
- Poured off the supernatant into the waste 
- Let the tube dry for ~10 minutes upside down 
- Resuspended the pellet in 15ul of 10mM tris 
- Let pellet resuspend for about 10 minutes before use in the gel 

**20240118 Qubit**

- High sensitivity Qubit of the exonuclease treated samples, there may not really be anything left in these
- Followed this [Qubit protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCz0SBof6LHE3P_LbftawFyexl8iCECUlvjIcauPYwY/edit?usp=drive_link) 
- 16: 8.78ng/ul
- 17: 2.22ng/ul

**20240118 6 Hour gel**

- Prepared a 0.7% gel with the [Seakem](https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/US/en/Electrophoresis/p/000000000000182217/SeaKem%C2%AE-Gold-Agarose) agarose that is supposed to be better for gels with HMW DNA 
    - 160mL of 1X TAE 
    - 1.155g Seakem agarose 
- Microwaved until clear solution 
- Added 3ul of Midori stain and swirled
- Saved 1mL in a 1.5mL tube and placed in the heat block at 65C to stay warm and liquid 
- Poured the large gel and waited for it to solidify 
- Once solid, added 1 round of PFG marker to the 1st and 8th wells 
- Let the tube of gel cool for 2-3 minutes 
- Filled the wells with the PFG markers with the extra agarose and waited for those to solidify 
- Prepared the samples:
    - 16-exo: 14ul of DNA and 2.8ul of dye
    - 17-exo: 14ul of DNA and 2.8ul of dye 
- Added 48kb ladder and samples into the gel 
- Set the gel for 58V and 6 hours

This looks like the phenol cleanup could yield slightly higher molecular weight DNA, although I am not sure if this indicates intact viral genomes or not, it seems a little small. But I know that after ~50kb they just don't run very well on the gel. I also found [some information online](https://goldbio.com/articles/article/Interpreting-Gel-Electrophoresis-Results#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20monomer%20supercoiled%20covalently,supercoiled%20covalently%20closed%20circular%20monomer.) that suggests supercoiled closed circular DNA will run faster in a gel than you'd expect based on size. And this would be the form left from the exonuclease? I think it is best to proceed with using the phenol cleanup method after this treatment in the future.
