title: rp49 and p47 PCR on DiNV Infected Myd88 and W1118
---

## Amplifying rp49 (control product) and p47 (DiNV specific) PCR Products on Myd88 and W1118 Flies Infected with DiNV

Info on fly infections [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/05/02/myd88-w1118-dinv-infect.html)

Info on how 12 flies were randomly chosen and DNA extracted [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/05/11/12-fly-exteract.html). That link also include the table that indicates which sample is which extraction number.

**20220517 rp49 PCR**

- Primers are #s 8 and 9 in the oligo database
- Database also says they amplify a band a ~200bp when using a 55 degree C annealing temp
- I diluted the primers to 10uM by using 10ul of primer in 90ul of molecular grade water
- I have 12 samples, I need a negative control, and I have some W1118 DNA from Emma as a positive control
- Made mastermix on ice:
  - 5ul GoTaq * 15 = 75ul
  - 0.25ul rp49-F * 15 = 3.75ul
  - 0.25ul rp49-R * 15 = 3.75ul
  - 3.5ul molec grade water * 15 = 52.5ul
- Mix was vortexed and spun down
- Added 9ul of master mix to each strip tube
- Added 1ul of DNA to each tube and 1ul of water to the control tubes
- Tubes were ordered by extraction #
- Placed in the 55TEST PCR program
- Afterwards, the samples were run on a 2% gel for 35 minutes at 90V

This looks good! All the samples except 7 amplified for the melanogaster gene. Sample 7 had too low to read Qubit from the extraction, so there may be almost no DNA in there.

**20220519 p47_q PCR**
- Using the QPCR version of the p47 primers, this makes a ~100bp product
- I used a puregene kit DNA extracted from DV-1 cells infected with DiNV as my positive control
- Made mastermix on ice:
  - 5ul GoTaq * 15 = 75ul
  - 0.25ul p47_q-F * 15 = 3.75ul
  - 0.25ul p47_q-R * 15 = 3.75ul
  - 3.5ul molec grade water * 15 = 52.5ul
- Mix was vortexed and spun down
- Added 9ul of master mix to each strip tube
- Added 1ul of DNA to each tube and 1ul of water to the control tubes
- Tubes were ordered by extraction #
- Placed in the 55TEST PCR program
- Afterwards, the samples were run on a 2% gel for 35 minutes at 90V by Emma the next day

No amplification except for in the positive control. This is somewhat to be expected, I may not have poked the flies hard enough or DiNV wasn't able to infect them well. I should have tried amplifying the liquid I infected them with. I will try that next.
