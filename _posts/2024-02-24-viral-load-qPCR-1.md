title: Two sets of qPCR on viral load samples
---

## PIF 3 and TPI PCR on D. innubila injected with dilutions of DiNV from day 0, 1, 3, and 5 set 1 and 2 

Sample information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14mcSX0mDDw-3cea6Oii0t9ylY7oqrMfXe3hAOwqSgEg/edit?gid=938060891#gid=938060891), and injection information is [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/12/12/DiNV-dilution-viral-load-injections.html)

Samples were thawed on ice and vortexed and spun down. 
Samples were placed in order for qPCR in 2 96 well plates and diluted 1:10 needed for qPCR: 27ul of DNA hydration solution and 3ul of DNA. These were then frozen until use for qPCR. Plates were sealed with 8 strip caps.

The plan is to do every sample only once (no tech reps in qPCR) but there will be 8 bio reps per treatment 

**qPCR of Plate 1 with PIF3 and TPI**

- Thawed plate 1 on ice, pipette mixed each well, then spun down 
- Prepared mixes for qPCR on ice, everything was thawed on ice, vortexed and spun down before use:

|reagent|PIF 3|TPI|
|---|---|---|
|SSo|520ul|520ul|
|F primer|52ul|52ul|
|R primer|52ul|52ul|
|molec grade water|312ul|312ul|

- 9ul of PIF 3 mix was added to each well in a qPCR plate 
- Added 1ul of diluted sample to each well of the plate using a multichannel: using Plate 1 
- Pipette mixed each well with the multichannel 
- Sealed the plate
- Spun down the plate at 4,000rpm for 5 min 
- Placed the plate in the qPCR machine with the KMM-P47 program 
- This ran for ~1.5 hours, in the last half hour I prepared the TPI plate in the same way as above 
- I also used only plate 1 DNA 
- Ran the TPI plate on the same KMM-P47 program

**qPCR of Plate 1 with PIF3 and TPI was done on 20240225**

 Thawed plate 2 on ice, pipette mixed each well, then spun down 
- Prepared mixes for qPCR on ice, everything was thawed on ice, vortexed and spun down before use:

|reagent|PIF 3|TPI|
|---|---|---|
|SSo|520ul|520ul|
|F primer|52ul|52ul|
|R primer|52ul|52ul|
|molec grade water|312ul|312ul|

- 9ul of PIF 3 mix was added to each well in a qPCR plate 
- Added 1ul of diluted sample to each well of the plate using a multichannel: using Plate 2 
- Pipette mixed each well with the multichannel 
- Sealed the plate
- Spun down the plate at 4,000rpm for 5 min 
- Placed the plate in the qPCR machine with the KMM-P47 program 
- This ran for ~1.5 hours, in the last half hour I prepared the TPI plate in the same way as above
