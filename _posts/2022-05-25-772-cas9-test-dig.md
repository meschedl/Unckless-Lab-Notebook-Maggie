title: 77-2 Test Cas9 Digest
---

## Testing 77kb Guide RNAs 86 and 92 on the 77-2 PCR Product in a Cas9 Test Digestion

**Dilutions and Preparation**
- sgRNAs were already diluted in [previous digestion](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/05/18/771-cas9-dig.html) to 300nM
- To make sure that the Cas9 was as enzymatically active, I did another dilution to 1uM:
  - 39ul diluent B
  - 2ul 20uM Cas9 enzyme
- I had done 2 more 77-2 50ul PCR reactions, combined them together, and cleaned them up with beads
- This yielded me not very much DNA still, but I decided to procede anyways
- 77-2 PCR product was 14.4ng/ul
- The size is 1,891bp
- Equation for DNA ng/ul to nM:
  - nM = ((ng/ul)/(660g/mol * size in bp)) * 1000000
- 77-2: ((14.4ng/ul)/(660g/mol * 1,891bp) * 1000000) = 12nM
- I needed 30uM, but I decided to try it anyways, and to add an extra ul in to increase the amount of DNA

**Set up and Procedure**

|tube number | PCR product|sgRNA|Cas9|reaction type|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|77-2|No sgRNA |No Cas9| control|
|2|77-2|No sgNRA|+ Cas9|control|
|3|77-2|+sgRNA 86|No Cas9| control|
|4|77-2|+sgRNA 92|No Cas9|control|
|5|77-2|+sgRNA 86|+ Cas9|digest test|
|6|77-2|+sgRNA 92|+ Cas9|digest test|

- Set the thermocycler program:
  - 25 decree C hold
  - 25 degree C 10 minutes
  - 37 degree C hold
  - 37 degree C 15 minutes
- Thawed all reagents on ice and made mixes on ice
- Made master mix:
  - 20ul molec grade water * 7 = 140ul
  - 3ul NEB buffer r3.1 * 7 = 21ul
- Pipette mixed and spun down
- Added 23ul master mix to each tube (of 6 strip tubes)
- Added 3ul 300nM sgRNA 86 to tubes 3 and 5
- Added 3ul 300nM sgRNA 92 to tubes 4 and 6
- Added 3ul water to tubes 1 and 2
- Added 1ul 1nM Cas9 to tubes 2, 5, and 6
- Added 1ul water to tubes 1, 3, and 4
- Pipette mixed tubes and spun them down
- Incubated the tubes in the thermocycler for 10 minutes at 25 degrees C
- Took out the tubes and added 4ul of 77-2 PCR to every tube
- Pipette mixed and spun down tubes
- Incubated tubes in the thermocycler for 15 minutes at 37 degrees C
- Took tubes out and added 1ul of Qiagen proteinase K to each
- Pipette mixed and spun down tubes
- Incubated the tubes at room temp for 10 minutes
- Afterwards, I put the tubes in the freezer overnight

**Gel 20220525**
- I made a 2% gel for this
- 10ul of sample were run with 2ul of loading dye
- Gel ran at 100V for ~35 minutes
- And stained for 35 minutes

This is a great gel pic, and it shows clear digestion for both sgRNAs, with 86 working better. I can see that it looks like sgRNA 92 is a little bit degraded/fuzzy or maybe lower concentration. That could explain that it has incomplete digestion.

It is great that this still worked even though the PCR concentration was not right.
