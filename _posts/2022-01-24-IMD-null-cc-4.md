title: Week of 20220124 Cell Culture Preparation - IMD Null

## Cell Culture Preparation of IMD Null Eggs

#### 20220124 Making Yeast Plates
- Used yeast paste made the week before
- Then that afternoon, made 2 apple juice yeast plates with 2 steaks of yeast on each plate

### 20220125 Setting up IMD null Flies to Lay

- Set up 8 vials of IMD Null flies to lay on the yeast plate at about 2pm

### 20220126 Day 1 Cell Culture
- Collected the apple juice plate at ~9:30am and replaced the cage with a new plate for more laying
- Roughly followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html), but also used the modifications from the [innubila cell culture last week](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/01/10/innubila-laying-plate-test.html) that did not use trypsin and minimized washes. I have a hypothesis that using the trypsin is hurting the cells because the innubila cells from last week look more alive and larger than all of my other cells
- Used the 0% FBS and 20% FBS Schneider's medium with no gentamicin made the week before, and new medium was made for the next day
- There were many more eggs on the plate this day
- Flasks were imaged in the afternoon:
