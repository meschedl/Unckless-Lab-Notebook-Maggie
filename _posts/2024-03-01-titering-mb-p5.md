title: Antibody Stating Dv-1 Cells for Titering
---

## Antibody Staining and Counting [Fixed Dv-1 Cells](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/02/29/fixing-cells.html) That Had Been Inoculated with 2 Stocks of DiNV 

The two plates were treated the same. Buffers for staining were made up [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/02/28/solutions-titering.html)

- Took buffers out of fridge to warm to room temp 
- Took plates out of freezer to warm to room temp 
- Dripped blocking buffer into each well of each plate that had cells until wells were half full 
- Covered plates and incubated at room temp on the bench for 30 mintues 
- Prepared the antibody soluion:
    - Diluting the antibody 1:1000
    - 25mL needed todat with 500ul per well 
    - 25mL DPBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween to a 50mL conical 
    - 25ul primary antibody (stored in glycerol)
    - Inverted to mix 
- Dumped and tapped out plates on paper towels after 30 min incubation 
- Added 500ul antibody solution to each well of cells in each plate 
- Incubated plates in the dark in a drawer for 1 hour covered 
- After incubation dumped and tapped out plates on paper towels 
- Washed 3 times with DPBS: 
    - Added DPBS to each well gently 
    - Let plates sit in dark for 10 minutes 
    - Dumped and tapped out plates on paper towels 
- Prepared conjugate antibody:
    - Diluting antibody 1:4000
    - 11mL needed for 200ul per well 
    - Solution made in the dark and kept dark 
    - 11mL DPBS 
    - 2.75ul Alexa fluor 488 
    - Inverted to mix
- After 3rd wash, worked in a dark room 
- Added 200ul conjugate to each well in the plates with cells 
- Incubated plates in the drawed covered for 1 hour 
- After incubation dumped and tapped out plates on paper towels, in the dark
- Washed 3 times with DPBS in the dark: 
    - Added DPBS to each well gently 
    - Let plates sit in dark for 10 minutes 
    - Dumped and tapped out plates on paper towels
- For last wash I did not dump out the DPBS
- Wrapped plates in foil and brought upstairs to the Ackley lab to use their microscope 

**Counting**
- Looked at each well in the plates to find a dilution that had ~50 glowing dots to use for the FFU calculation 
- For the Passage 5 DiNV stock this was the last column, or 10^-5 dilution:
    - well 1: 32 FFU
    - well 2: 32 FFU
    - well 3: 29 FFU
    - well 4: 18 FFU 
    - Average: 27.75 FFU
    - There were a lot of cells washed away in these wells but it seemed probably consistant across all the wells and plates, hard to tell. This is the issue with Dv-1 cells 
- For the Middle Band (MB) DiNV stock I used the 4th column, or 10^-3 dilution 
    - well 1: 104 FFU
    - well 2: 112 FFU
    - well 3: 115 FFU
    - well 4: 91 FFU
    - Average: 105.5 FFU
- I also took representative images of the wells I counted, the [raw images in LOF format can be found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o061JGolYJG9z71CyA4c0jkODW-zQtRD) and these need to be opened with image J 
- Then I used the equation to calculate the titers of the stocks from these averages 
- Equation: (FFU average * (1000ul/ul virus added))/dilution factor of counted wells 
    - note 200ul of virus solution was added to each well 
- So for Passage 5 the FFU titer came out to be: 13,875,000 FFU/mL
- And for the Midde Band the FFU titer came out to be: 527,500 FFU/mL 
- [Aliquots of these stocks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fC4pq-irF1vbZV3jOCGytjqUvz0kdOMjRo5ncT7A3gA/edit?gid=0#gid=0) are stored at -80 in my virus stock box with titers listed
