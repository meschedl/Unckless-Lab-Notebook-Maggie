Title: Cell Culture Check in 20220815
---

## Mini Cell Culture Inventory 20220815

Myd88 passage 8 from 8/11 3 flasks
- Looks really good already
- Could be passaged but I probably want to wait a few more days

IMD null 7/29 4 flasks
- In every flask there are many clumps of cells contracting!
- Most clumps of cells have settle to the bottom of the flasks
- Lots of debris in the flasks
- No areas that have a large amount of growth but this looks promising for the new method of homogenizing the eggs
- The egg yield was very high for these flasks

10236 Domeless 08/11 2 flasks
- Not seeing any contracting clumps
- Clumps of cells have settled, they are just sparce and the cells look really small
- There were not many eggs collected this day

10263 Domeless 08/12 3 flasks
- More cell clumps than the 8/11 flasks
- Not seeing any clumps contracting though
- Some cell clumps have settled on the flasks, it might be too early to tell with these flasks

innubila 8/11 2 flasks
- Found 1 clump contracting
- These flasks are very sparce, some clumps of cells have settled down but they are spread out
- Not many eggs were collected

innubila 08/12 2 flasks
- Found 1 clump contracting
- Very similar to the 8/11 flasks
- It seems like there weren't enough eggs for these flasks to get homogenized properly, I remember struggling to get all the eggs to break up

innubila passage 2 06/06 from 02/24
- Lots of preciptate
- Clumps of cells look alive but there seems to be little growth
- Not many clumps of cells

innubila passage 2 06/06 from 02/25
- Also lots of precipitate
- More clumps of cells than the ones from 02/24
- Some areas of cells growing out

innubila passage 2 04/25 from 02/25
- 1 flask it ok, and has some good areas of growth
- Another flask has some areas of growth but not as many
- The 3rd flask had nothing alive/growing and was thrown out

innubila passage 2 04/25 from 02/24
- Not very much going on in these flasks
- Seems like a lot of cells are floating
- Keep for not but little hope
