## Exonuclease Treatment on DNA Intended for Use in Electroporation 

**20240125 Preparing Samples and Treatment**

- Kept DNA on ice, flicked to mix and spun down 
- Want to do 1ug to 500ng for each sample 
- Prepared samples in 1.5mL tubes 

|sample|DNA vol|10mM tris vol|total DNA|
|---|---|---|---|
|20|12.9ul|17.1ul|1000ng|
|21|8.47ul|21.53ul|1000ng|
|22|12.6ul|17.4ul|1000ng|
|23|14.7ul|15.3ul|1000ng|
|24|11.9ng|18.1ng|500ng|
|25|9.4ul|20.6ul|500ng|

- Thawed NEBuffer 4 and ATP on ice, vortexed and spun down 
- Exo V enzyme kept on ice 
- To each tube added:
    - 4ul NEBuffer 4
    - 4ul ATP
    - 2ul exonuclease V 
- Tubes were flicked to mix and spun down 
- Placed tubes at 37C heat block for 1 hour 
- Warmed the oven to 70C because the other heat block was taken 
- After the 1 hour, the samples were transferred to a pre-warmed tube rack in the 70C oven for 30 min 

**20240125 Phenol Chloroform Cleanup**

I want these samples after the cleanup to be more concentrated than the other times I have done this, so I decided to pool the samples into only 2 samples 

- Combined samples 20, 21, and 24 together into 1 1.5mL tube with clipped pipette tips
- Combined samples 22, 23, and 25 together into 1 1.5mL tube with clipped pipette tips 
- Added 180ul of 10mM tris HCL to each tube to bring the volumes up to 300ul 
- Further processes were done in the hood 
- Added equal volume (~300ul) of cold phenol-chloroform isoamy alcohol
- Inverted to mix
- Placed tube on orbital shaker for 10 minutes 
- Centrifuged tube for 15 minutes at 16,000rcf at room temp 
- Removed the top layer into new final labeled tubes:
    - 20: 300ul
    - 22: 305ul
- Added 0.1X volume of 3M sodium acetate to the tube 
    - 20: 30ul
    - 22: 30.5ul
- Added 2-2.5X volume of cold 100% ethanol to the tube: I added 750ul which is 2.5X
- Mixed by inverting many times 
- Placed sample in the -20 overnight 
- Placed the centrifuge in the 4C to cool overnight

**20240126 Finish Cleanup**

- Centrifuged tube at 4C for 30 minutes at 16,000rcf 
    - I did see a pellet in both tubes
- Pipetted off the supernatant into the waste 
- Added 500ul of cold fresh 80% ethanol 
- Inverted the tube twice 
- Centrifuged the tube at 4C for 30 minutes at 16,000rcf 
- Pipetted off the supernatant into the waste 
- Let the tube dry for ~15 minutes upside down 
- Resuspended the pellets in 20ul of 10mM tris 
- Let pellet resuspend for a few hours before qubiting 
- Qubit followed [this protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCz0SBof6LHE3P_LbftawFyexl8iCECUlvjIcauPYwY/edit) for high sensitivity reagents 
    - 20: 28.8ng/ul 
    - 22: 32.5ng/ul
