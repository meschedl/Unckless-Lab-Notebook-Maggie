## Cell Culture Preparation of IMD Null Eggs

#### 20220103 Making Yeast Plates
- Used yeast paste that Kent had made and autoclaved twice. I think this yeast was made the week of 20211220
- Then that afternoon, made 2 apple juice yeast plates with 2 steaks of yeast on each plate

### 20220104 Setting up IMD null Flies to Lay

- Set up 5 vials of IMD null flies to lay on the yeast plate at about 2pm

### 20220105 Day 1 Cell Culture
- Collected the apple juice plate at ~9:45am and replaced the cage with a new plate for more laying
- Followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html)
- Used freshly made that day 20% FBS Schneider's medium, and 0% FBS Schneider's medium with NO gentamicin:
  - 2 50mL conicals No FBS:
  - 49.5mL Schneider's Drosophila medium
  - 500ul 100X antibiotics
  - 1 50mL conical 20% FBS:
  - 39.5mL Schneider's Dosophila medium
  - 10mL FBS
  - 500ul 100X antibiotics
- Flies laid a good number of eggs, however in one of the last steps the cell pellet seems to have gotten sucked up in a wash or something because the usual cell clump was no longer present when dispensing into the flasks. And there were few cells in the flasks after settling
- Flasks were left to settle and imaged the next week

### 20220106 Day 2 Cell Culture
- Collected the apple juice plate at ~9:45am and disposed of the flies
- Followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html)
- Used the 0% FBS and 20% FBS Schneider's medium made the day before
- There were many more eggs on the plate this day
- Flasks were looked at but not imaged until the next week

### 20220111 Imaging Flasks
- Flasks from 20220105 did not have many cells at all:

- Flasks from 20220106 had a good number of single cells and clumps still looking pretty alive:

### 20220112 Adding Medium
- 1mL of 20% FBS medium no gentamicin was added to 1 of the flasks. It was marked as FA
