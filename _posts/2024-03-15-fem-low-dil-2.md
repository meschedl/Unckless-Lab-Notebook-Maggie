title: Female innubila 0.05 FFU DiNV Replicate 2 Infections 
---

##  Female D. innubila Injections with 0.01, 0.05, and 0.005 FFU DiNV Second Replicate

First replicate is [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/02/21/low-dilutions-rep-2.html), and the DiNV solution was diluted in the exact same way. The only difference was that tube 33 of virus solution was used. 

Female flies had been separated out 2 days before and should be 5-7 days old and were kept with males, so hopefully all are mated. 

Infections followed the [nanoinjector protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/Nanoject-Dinnubila-DiNV-Infection-Protocol.md) exactly. 

Some flies were included in this infection for Kent, but their mortality was not used for analysis.
