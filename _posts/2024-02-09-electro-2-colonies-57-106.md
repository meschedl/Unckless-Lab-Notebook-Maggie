title: Colony PCR on Electroporation 2 Set 2

## Second Set of Colony PCR  Plates from Electroporation 2 of pSPIN-BAC E. coli with DiNV DNA 

I again decided to pick 5 more colonies from each DiNV plate from [electroporation 2](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/02/05/electro-DiNV-DNA-2.html). The plates had been in the 4C since being grown.

I prepared 50 strip tubes with 5ul of molecular grade water. I also prepared 2 LB plates with chloramphenicol (20ul of 50% stock chlor was spread on each plate and let soak in and warm for ~30 min before use) to keep the colonies on. The plates had a grid layout with 25 spots per plate:

For each colony of the DiNV plates I picked a colony with a new pipette tip, dipped it on the plate square, and then dipped and spun it in the strip tube for that colony. This way I could keep growing each colony. The plates were left to grow overnight and the put in the fridge to store. 

Colonies 57-81 were from the DiNV-1 plates. Colonies 82-106 were from the DiNV-2 plates. All information about the colonies can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bIOcGiGOEq-CnrpFV6pnzy-1kQTJCmN1zR0gOnc1EM/edit#gid=0). 

All colonies were then run through 3 PCR primers separately and ran out on gels and products scored. PCR followed the [general PCR protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/PCR_protocol_general.md). 

Mastermix volumes are shown here:

|Reagent|p47|16S|lef9|
|---|---|---|---|
|GoTaq|275ul|275ul|275ul|
|F primer|13.75ul|13.75ul|13.75ul|
|R primer|13.75ul|13.75ul|13.75ul|
|molecular grade water|192.5ul|192.5ul|192.5ul|

4 separate gels were run because of issues with staining on double laned gels:
