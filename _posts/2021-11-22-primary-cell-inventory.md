## Inventory, Check, and Imaging of Primary Cells in the Incubator: How Are They Doing?

### 33098 Dicer (last week)

**11/19 flasks**  
These are new flasks, and they look good. Many single cells:

From a zoomed out view at 4x, most of those dots are cells or cell clumps. This is a very good yield, it has not been as uniform in previous attempts.

There are some cell clumps, I think that come from the great volume of cells/eggs I got. These mostly seem to be cells and some debris.

**11/18 flasks**  
Very similar to the 11/19 flasks, many single cells and some clumps. So far it looks clear in terms of everything else.

### SPZ

**11/5 flasks**  
These are interesting. There are still a good amount of cells that look ok, mostly in small clumps.

But there is something else going on, there are these little filaments in the liquid that look like tiny hairs (probably not what they are), but I don't have a clue if they're alive or not. The liquid in the flask is pretty clear, and you'd expect it to be opaque if stuff was over growing it.

There is also this alignment of these small things on the flask. I don't really think these are cells (or at least _Drosophila_ cells), they could be dead yeast. I don't know why they are in this pattern, but it could be just because of a scratch on the flask. The cells around it are much larger, I guess if could be some dead cell pieces.

**11/4 flasks**  
In these I wasn't able to find cells. It does have the same weird filaments or precipitate though. These are probably ok to toss out to open up more incubator space.

### 10263 Domeless

**11/11 flasks**   
Lots of cells, it hasn't been that long so they look like they're doing ok. The cells look a little smaller/shrunken, but it's hard to tell.

There are some big debris clumps (in red) that differ from what are cells (purple). This could be debris, yeast, parts of dead cells, I'm not sure. But that kind of stuff is in pretty much all of the flasks.

**11/12 flasks**  
Similar to the 11th flasks, lots of cells still looking ok, as well as clumps and debris.

### IMD Null

**10/22 flasks**  
These have been in here for a month at this point. There is a huge grouping of cells in the center of the flasks (for some reason things slowly go to the center overtime). There is also a ton of debris. My guess is that this is stuff is leftovers from cells that died (blue circle). There still looks like there are cells though that are ok (red circle).

**10/21 flasks**  
There is still an ok amount of cells in these flasks. They look a little sad though.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/20211021-imdnull-imaged-20211122-3.jpeg)
There are the clumps of little debris things in these flasks too, like in all of the flasks.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/master/images/20211021-imdnull-imaged-20211122-1.jpeg)
There is also this weird precipitate or crystal thing in these flasks. This is floating in the medium and not on the flask surface. My only guess is that it comes from the  medium? But there are other flasks that do not have this, and have the same medium, so I'm not sure. It could show up over time?

**It looks like the 32064 Dicer 2 flasks from 10/27 and 10/28 were thrown out. They had low yield of eggs and barely any cells to begin with**

### Myd88 fluid change and transfer flasks

**10-8 transfer 10-29 flasks**   
I think  this means that the liquid from the top of the flask was transferred on the 29th. There are a few single cells that look fine here. There is also a lot lot of that small debris thing.

**10-8 fluid change 10-29flasks**  
There are some single cells in these too, those small debris things are everywhere as well. Interestingly, there are those crystal precipitate things in these flasks, although they aren't as big.
