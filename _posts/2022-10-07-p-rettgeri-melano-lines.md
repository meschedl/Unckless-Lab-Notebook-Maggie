title: P. rettgeri Infections on Multiple Lines
---

## Trying P. rettgeri Infections Again on Multiple Lines of Melanogaster Flies

Lines are: W1118, c564, Dpt null 1I, and IMD null. W1118 and c564 are WT and Dpt null and IMD null are lines that should be very sensitive to P. rettgeri.

Infections followed [this general protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/bacteria_fly_infections.md), and the bacteria was grown overnight in liquid cultures, and diluted to an OD of 1 before using. Lines all had flies of slightly different ages, some too young and some too old. But they were all sort of the right age, and I wanted to just see what would happen here. A few days before all flies were separated out into vials of ~10 males with ~5 females to make infection quicker day of.

| Vial | line     | Treatment   | time infected | fly age | Number of flies per vial |

| 3    | IMD null | P. rettgeri | 4:12 PM       | 3-4     | 7                        |

| 7    | dpt null | P. rettgeri | 4:36 PM       | 4-6     | 10                       |
| 8    | IMD null | P. rettgeri | 4:42 PM       | 3-4     | 10                       |
| 9    | dpt null | P. rettgeri | 4:48 PM       | 4-6     | 10                       |
| 10   | c564     | P. rettgeri | 4:53 PM       | 4-8     | 10                       |
| 11   | c564     | P. rettgeri | 4:58 PM       | 4-8     | 10                       |
| 12   | W1118    | P. rettgeri | 5:03 PM       | 8-10    | 10                       |
| 13   | IMD null | LB          | 5:08 PM       | 3-4     | 8                        |
