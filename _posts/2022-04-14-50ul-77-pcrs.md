## 50ul PCRs for 77kb-DiNV To Make Enough For Cas9 Digestion Assay

**20220414 77-DiNV-1**

- Basically I wanted to scale up my usual PCR ratio by 5
- Going to use my 2mL sample as the sample and water as a negative control
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 5ul GoTaq * 5 * 2.2 = 55ul
  - 0.25ul 77-F-1 * 5 * 2.2 = 2.75ul
  - 0.25ul 77-R-1 * 5 * 2.2 = 2.75ul
  - 3.5 ul H2O * 5 * 2.2 = 38.5ul
- Vortexed and spun down mix
- Added 45ul of mix to 2 PCR tubes
- Added 5ul of 2mL DNA to the first tube
- Added 5ul molecular grade water to the second tube
- Vortexed and spun down PCR tubes
- Placed PCR tubes in the thermocycler 77-DiNV-1 program
  - 95 degrees C 2 min
  - _95 degrees C 30 sec_
  - _52 degrees C 1 minute_
  - _72 degrees C 1 minutes, 30 seconds_
  - 72 degrees C 5 min
  - 12 degrees C hold
  - Italic lines are cycled 34 times
- I made sure to change the volume to 50ul
- Afterwards 5ul of the PCR was run on a 1% gel for 35 minutes at 90V:

Looks good!

- I modified the PCR a little bit for this to get only 1 band (and at the right size)
- I used 3/4th of the usual amount of primers
- Made master mix on ice:
  - 5ul GoTaq * 5 * 2.2 = 55ul
  - 0.187ul 77-F-1 * 5 * 2.2 = 2.057ul
  - 0.187ul 77-R-1 * 5 * 2.2 = 2.057ul
  - 3.63 ul H2O * 5 * 2.2 = 39.93ul
- Vortexed and spun down mix
- Added 45ul of mix to 2 PCR tubes
- Added 5ul of 2mL DNA to the first tube
- Added 5ul molecular grade water to the second tube
- Vortexed and spun down PCR tubes
- Placed PCR tubes in the thermocycler 77-DiNV-1 program
  - 95 degrees C 2 min
  - _95 degrees C 30 sec_
  - _53 degrees C 1 minute_
  - _72 degrees C 2 minutes_
