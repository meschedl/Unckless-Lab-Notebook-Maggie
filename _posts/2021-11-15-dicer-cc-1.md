title: Week of 20211115 Cell Culture Preparation - 33098 Dicer
---

## Cell Culture Preparation of 33098 Dicer Eggs

#### 20211115 Making Fresh Yeast Paste
- I made fresh yeast paste by using ~20mL of dry yeast, ~20mL of molecular grade water, and a few mL of apple juice. I added in some extra yeast to get the consistency right. Wanted it to be kind of like royal icing
- Autoclaved on program 3 twice on 20211115

### 202111116 Making Yeast Plates

- Made sure the scooper/spatula was autoclaved
- In the afternoon, made 2 apple juice yeast plates with 2 streaks of yeast on each plate

### 20211117 Setting up 33098 Dicer Flies to Lay

- Set up 5 vials of 33098 Dicer flies to lay on the yeast plate at about 2pm, this has been the most flies I've used so far

### 20211118 Day 1 Cell Culture
- Collected the apple juice plate at ~9:45am and replaced the cage with a new plate for more laying
- Followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html)
- Used 0% FBS medium made on 20211109 and 10% FBS medium made on 20211102
- Used Trypsin opened 20211111
- For added sterility: after every time doing something out of the TC hood, I sprayed my gloves with ethanol before going back into the hood (centrifuges, etc.)
- Yield of eggs was very good
- Flasks were left to settle overnight and looked at the next day
- Supplies were put in the autoclave in the lab to sterilize for the next day
- New 0% FBS and 10% FBS 420 mediums were made for the next day


### 20211119 Day 2 Cell Culture
- Collected apple juice plate at ~9:30am, flies were placed in the morgue
- Followed the [Prepping Cell Culture Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2021/10/26/cell-culture-protocol.html)
- Used 0% FBS made on 20211109 and 20211118, and 10% FBS made on 20211118
- Opened new Trypsin: 20211119
- For added sterility: after every time doing something out of the TC hood, I sprayed my gloves with ethanol before going back into the hood (centrifuges, etc.)
- Again there was a lot of eggs, the most I've ever gotten. I think I hit a great amount of files in the cage for laying with five vials

- Flasks were left to settle over the weekend before looking at them

### 20211122 Imaging Flasks After the Weekend

Flasks from 20211119: lots of single cells that look really good.

At 4X magnification you can see that there's a lot of them, most of the specs are cells

I had a problem again with the cell pellet after homogenization and while washing with medium, it did not want to break up. I think these are clumps of cells re-stuck together after homogenization. I used pipette mixing to break them up a little in the flasks, but they still do show up. Hopefully there is not much "junk" in these, and it's mostly just cells.

Flasks from 20211118: similar to the 19th, many cells, some clumps. Obviously it's early, but they all look good.
