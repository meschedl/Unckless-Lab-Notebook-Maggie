## Testing Nanoject II Infections with 16Cq DiNV on D. innubila 

Because the [first test injections](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2023/08/25/testing-injector-needle.html) with control fluid on innubila seemed to go ok, I decided to test doing real infections with DiNV to see if this method would give me a robust infection. I decided to use the 27.6nl I had tested previously because it is the middle volume the machine can give, so I can adjust up or down in the future if needed. I used the 16Cq virus cell culture fluid because it has given me good infections in the past. 

I did my best to make sure the infection went sterilely with the new method. The day before, 2 vials of 5 males and 2 females, and 7 vials of 11 males and 4 females were made up. These will be the males I will infect

**Set up area**
- Thawed 16Cq virus on ice and changed gloves after touching 
- Made 7 new vials of mushroom food 
- Wiped down fly room bench with 95% ethanol before using/putting things on it
- Things taken to the fly room 
    - tube rack with 10 tubes for day 0
    - mineral oil
    - sterile Co2 pad
    - pulled needles
    - sterile forceps (2)
    - two sets of gloves
    - 95% ethanol
    - Nanoject 
    - autoclaved toothpicks
    - Notebook
    - Virus and control medium on ice 
- Used one of the forceps to clip off the tip of one of the pulled needles
- Used the metal needle to backfill the pulled needle with mineral oil, avoiding any bubbles 
- Placed the pulled needle on the machine
    - Slide the collet onto the needle
    - Pushed the 2nd o-ring onto the needle
    - Slid the needle onto the machine 
    - Tightened the collet down 
    - (this method is easier than pushing the needle through the ring on the machine)
- Ejected the mineral oil until the beep
- Filled the needle with control medium (10% FBS, 4% mushroom Schneider's medium with antibiotics)
- Tested needle to make sure fluid ejects when pressing inject 

**Injecting flies**
- Placed 1st vial of 5 flies on CO2
- Separated out males with toothpick
- Injected each fly with 27.6nl control medium 
- Placed each fly in 1.5mL tubes with forceps, dipped in 95% ethanol between each fly 
- Placed 1st vial of 10 flies on CO2
- Separated out males with toothpick
- Injected each fly with 27.6nl control medium 
- Used toothpick to place flies in new vial 
- Repeated steps for 2 more vials for all the control flies 
- _Note here I tried to remove all the control medium from the needle by pressing eject and then tried to fill it with virus fluid but I broke the needle. So I had to get another needle, break off the tip, backfill it, and fill it with virus for the infection treatment flies. So two needles were used._
- For virus infected flies, infections went the same way:
- Placed 2nd vial of 5 flies on CO2
- Separated out males with a newtoothpick
- Injected each fly with 27.6nl 16Cq virus
- Placed each fly in 1.5mL tubes with forceps, dipped in 95% ethanol between each fly (separate pair of forceps from the control flies)
- Placed next vial of 10 flies on CO2
- Separated out males with the virus toothpick
- Injected each fly with 27.6nl 16Cq virus 
- Used virus toothpick to place flies in new vial 
- Repeated those steps for 3 more vials 

The time of infection and duration on CO2 was recorded for each fly:

|vial|treatment|volume|time|time on CO2|n#|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|control medium|27.6nl|3:34pm|6 min| 9|
|2|control medium|27.6nl|3:41pm| 6 min| 10|
|3|control medium|27.6nl|3:48pm|7 min|10|
|4|16Cq DiNV|27.6nl|4:39pm|6m min|10|
|5|16Cq DiNV|27.6nl|4:45pm |7 min|9|
|6|16Cq DiNV|27.6nl|4:53pm| 6 min|10|
|7|16Cq DiNV|27.6nl|4:59pm|6 min| 10|

The flies that were frozen for day 1:

|tube#|treatment|
|1|CCM|
|2|CCM|
|3|CCM
|4|CCM
|5|CCM
|6|DiNV|
|7|DiNV|
|8|DiNV|
|9|DiNV|
|10|DiNV|

Mortality is assessed every day, and flies are transferred on CO2 every 3 days. When transferred, dead flies are frozen.
