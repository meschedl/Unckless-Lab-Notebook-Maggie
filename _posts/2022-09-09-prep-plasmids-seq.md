## Preparing pSL1142, pCS2+8EGFP, and pAc5.1B EGFP for Plasmidsaurus Sequencing

**Plasmidsaurus has a drop box in Haworth at the Biostore that is picked up at 1pm on Mondays. For sequencing, they require at least 10ul of purified plasmid that is at 30ng/ul concentration.**

**Bead Clean pSL1142**  
- None of my extracts for pSL1142 were at 30ng/ul or higher, so I decided to combine them all and bead clean and concentrate them
- Took the beads out ~30 minutes before use, swirled to mix and left in a drawer to warm
- Combined all extract tubes into 1 single tube, ~144ul volume total
- Added 1X (144ul) beads to the sample tube and pipette mixed at least 10 times
- Placed the tube on the orbital shaker 150rpm for 15 minutes
- Prepared fresh 80% ethanol
- Placed the tube on the magnet stand and waited for the liquid to go clear
- Pipetted off most of the liquid without disturbing the beads
- Added 500ul 80% ethanol to the tube
- Waited ~30 seconds
- Removed the ethanol
- Added another 500ul 80% ethanol to the tube
- Waited ~30 seconds
- Removed all ethanol, using a small pipette for any droplets left
- Waited ~5 minutes for the tubes to dry, but did not let the beads get dry
- Resuspended the beads in 41ul 10mM Tris HCl
- Placed the tube back on the shaker for 5 minutes
- Placed the tube back on the magnet and waited until the liquid went clear
- Removed 40ul into a new final tube
- Qubit:
  - 52.6ng/ul

**Prep Plasmid DNA for Sequencing**
- DNA was prepped the Friday before so it would be ready on the Monday
- For pCS2 + 8EGFP and pAc5.1B EGFP I made 20ul of 30ng/ul plasmid
- For pSL1142 pSPIN I made 12ul of 30ng/ul
- pCS2 + 8EGFP:
  - 20ul of 30ng/ul is 600ng total DNA needed
  - 600ng/150ng/ul = 4ul plasmid DNA
  - 16ul 10mM Tris HCl
- pAc5.1B GFP:
  - 20ul of 30ng/ul is 600ng total DNA needed
  - 600ng/92.7ng/ul = 6.47ul plasmid DNA
  - 13.53ul 10mM Tris HCl
- pSL1142 pSPIN
  - 12ul of 30ng/ul is 360ng total DNA needed
  - 360ng/52.6ng/ul = 6.84ul plasmid DNA
  - 5.16ul 10mM Tris HCl

**Sending for Sequencing 20220912**
- Liquid from these samples was pipetted into a 8 strip tube unlabeled along with some samples from Emma:
  - Tube 1 : pSL1142
  - Tube 2 : pCS2 + 8EGFP
  - Tube 3 : pAc5.1B GFP
  - Tube 4 : MW #35
  - Tube 5 : 35
  - Tube 6 : 41.2
  - Tube 7 : 41.3
- Then the tubes were labeled with the 3 character code provided by the company
- The caps were parafilmed, and the strip was put in a 50mL tube for transport
- The invoice was printed and put in a plastic bag with the samples, which was brought to the dropbox in the Biostore
