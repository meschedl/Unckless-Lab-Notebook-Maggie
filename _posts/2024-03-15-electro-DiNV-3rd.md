title: Electroporation of pSPIN-BAC Cells with DiNV for 3rd Integration Attempt
---

## 3rd Attempt at Electroporating pSPIN-BAC Cells with DiNV DNA for DiNV-BAC Integration 

Plan on doing 10 plates and screening ~100 colonies per plate, so like 1000 colonies checked from this attempt... 

**Prepping Plates**

- Making 10LB plates for first streaking 
- Making all plates with chloramphenicol resistance, also adding kanamycin to 2 of them 
- Made a diluted solution of chlor:
    - 150ul 100% ethanol 
    - 150ul stock chlor
- Spread 20ul of chlor solution on 10 LB plates, each with a new glass spreader from a pastur pipette
- For 2 plates added an additional 20ul of stock kanamycin 
- Let plates sit on bench to warm 

**Electroporation**

- Prepped 2 tubes of 975 SOC buffer
- Thawed 1 tube of electrocompetent pSPIN-BAC cells 
- Using 26-exo sample
- Brought up to Chandler lab: 
    - ice with bacteria and DNA
    - pipettes and tips
    - bacterial tip waste
    - tape
    - 20 1.5mL tubes
    - tubes with SOC buffer
- Placed SOC in 30C incubator to warm 
- Placed cuvette on ice to chill 
- Electroporation sample (just 1):
    - Added 25ul cells to 1.5mL tube on ice 
    - Added 2.5ul of 26-exo DNA 
    - Mixed and transferred to cuvette on ice 
    - Electroporated EC2 settings 
    - Added 975ul warmed SOC and mixed 
    - Transferred solution to 1.5mL tube 
    - Incubated tube at 30C for 1 hour shaking 

**Wash and Plate**

- Warmed LB to room temp 
- After incubation, took tube to 4012 and centrifuged 3 min at 3,000rpm
- Removed supernatant
- Resuspended pellet in 100ul of LB
- Spread 10ul of bacteria solution on each of the 10 plates made earlier with a sterile loop spreader
    - Plates 1 and 2 had the chlor and kan resistance 
- Placed plates in the 30C incubator to grow 

At low temp it takes a while to grow, so they went ~1.5 days and were put in the fridge at 9pm the next day
