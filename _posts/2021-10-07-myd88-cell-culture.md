Title: Myd88 Egg Collection and Cell Culture

## Myd88 Egg Collection and Cell Culture Prep with Kent (watching) 2021 10 07

**Egg Collection**
- Brought the second plate to the fly room
- Set up the CO2 plate at the station (turned on CO2, plugged in hose and turned valve)
- Flipped over fly cage onto the CO2 plate (top of the cage is mesh)
- Tapped down until all the flies are on the bottom and sleeping
- Took off the red end and squeezed to keep the plate in place
- Added in the second plate, and put the red part back onto the cage
- Let the flies wake up horizontally for a few minutes, then turned it upright and left for the next day
- We looked at the plate under the microscope: looks of effs on the plate, some visible in the agar, probably some in the yeast but we can’t see them. There are a few - hatched eggs already, we don’t want those though
- Myd88 might have difference hatching time than other flies, they were set up at 2pm ish yesterday, collected at ~9am

**Preparing Solutions for Filtering**
- New 70% ethanol
  - Rinsed graduated cylinder
  - Ethanol 200 proof in the flammable cabinet
  - 700mL ethanol in the cylinder
  - Added distilled water to 1000mL
  - Poured into a glass bottle on Kent’s bench for ethanol
  - Rinsed cylinder with tap water then distilled water
  - Poured out 70% ethanol into a small beaker on the bench
- Bought from the store: 50mL tubes, a large and small squirt bottle, and 2 containers of molecular grade water
- New 1X wash
  - 100mL 10X wash (used 50mL serological pipette)
  - 900mL molecular grade water
- Added molecular grade water to the large squirt bottle
- Added 1X wash to the small squirt bottle
- Made 50% bleach solution (for de-chorionating the embryos and sterilizing)
  - In a 50mL conical
  - 10mL bleach (under sink)
  - 10mL 1X wash

**Filtering**
- Used tweezer to pick off dead flies from the yeast and into the ethanol beaker
- Set up filter

  - Autoclaved flask at the bottom, yellow filter(100um, then green filter (400um), then funnel
- Took the egg plate and squirted a layer of water on it
- Used a paint brush to mix up the whole plate
  - Don’t dig into the agar
  - Want to break up the yeast/make it homogenous
- Tipped the plate over into the funnel
- Squirted water to rinse all the fluid into the funnel
- Repeated adding water to the plate because there were some yeast chunks left, brushed, and washed again
- Rinsed brush when done in the ethanol beaker
- Took off the funnel and the green filter
- Rinsed yellow filter with water
- Rinsed the yellow filter with 1X wash
- Squirt around the edges of the filter
- Wash for maybe 2-ish minutes, hard to know if the yeast is out but want to rinse for a while
- Got a new 50mL conical
- Flipped over the yellow filter into the conical opening
- Pipetted 10mL 50% bleach/wash solution slowly into the yellow filter to release the eggs
- Pipetted out the 10mL immediately (so the eggs don’t stick) into a glass 10mL siliconized tube
- Let the tube sit upright for 2-3 min to soak (pretty quick)
    - The eggs that are fertilized should start to settle out
- After the few min, centrifuge to pellet the embryos: program 2 (400rpm 3 min)

**In Tissue Culture Hood**
- Used siliconized pasteur pipette to aspirate off the bleach liquid (using vac)
- Added 10mL 420 medium without serum to the glass tube (medium made on 20211005)
- Inverted glass tube to mix and centrifuged in program 2
- Washing off the bleach
- After centrifugation, not all the eggs had pelleted but most of them had
- Aspirated off liquid from the center of the tube with a new pasteur pipette and the vacuum
- Added another 10mL of media without serum and inverted to mix
- Centrifuged in program 2
- Aspirated off liquid from the center of the tube with a new pasteur pipette and the vacuum
- Added another 10mL of media without serum for a total of 3 washes
- Used a siliconized pasteur pipette and a bulb to try to pipette disrupt the eggs on the side of the tube (didn’t work to well)
- Centrifuged in program 2
- Set the vacuum pretty low
- Used siliconized pasteur pipette and vac to aspirate until 200-300ul left
- Added 1.8mL of media with serum to the glass 10mL tube (2mL total)
- Made 2 25cm2 flasks with label: myd88 P1 primary 10/7
- Added 8mL of media with serum to one of the 25cm2 flasks
- Unwrapped the glass dounce (autoclaved) and set the receptacle in the 15mL rack in the TC hood
- Used a fresh siliconized pasteur pipette and bulb to resuspend the pelleted cells and transfer the liquid to the dounce receptacle
- Unwrap and put in the pestle
- Pushed down and twisted firmly on the pestle: but only for ~10 seconds! Pretty quickly, don’t want to over-mash
- Sucked up the liquid in the receptacle with a new siliconized pasteur pipette and bulb and added it to the 25cm2 flask with medium in it already
- Remove 5mL of the liquid from the first flask and add it to the unused flask
- Lay the flasks flat
- Looked at them in the scope immediately
  - Looks like single cells and good clumps of cells
  - Also looks like there is less yeast debris
- Put the flasks in the 23 degree incubator

**Cleanup (w/out Kent)**
- Rinsed out:
  - Erlynmyer flask from filtering
  - Dounce homogenizer and pestle
  - Beaker with ethanol
  - Siliconized 10mL glass tube
- Rinsed with tap water and DI
-  The 10mL tube had a lot of stuck eggs on it
  - I rinsed many many times, shook the tube with water in it and vortexed it for a long long time to remove as many eggs as possible
- Items above were prepared for autoclaving (foil wrap or lid, autoclave tape) and put in the autoclave under program 3
- All pasteur pipettes in the bucket in the TC hood were thrown in the glass disposal box
- Ethanol wiped the hood
- Rinsed the tip bucket in the hood, ethanol spray and dried
- Closed the hood sash, turned off the blower and the light
