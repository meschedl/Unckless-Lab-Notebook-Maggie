## Cell Culture Fluid Changes and Primary Cell Culture Weeks of 20220516 and 20220523

**A fluid change was performed on all flasks in the incubator on 20220516**
  - 3mL fluid removed
  - 3mL new 20% FBS added

**1 Myd88 secondary flask from 04/22 that was basically confluent was cell scraped, and separated out into 4 new flasks on 20220516**

**Primary cell culture on 20220523 and 20220524**

- For these cells, the egg laying scenario was slightly different:
  - Flies were put on plates in mid afternoon Saturday and left overnight
  - Then flies were swapped to a new plate in the morning on Sunday and left for 24 hours
  - Plates were not collected until at least 10:30am to facilitate morning laying
  - Then plates were left to “mature” (eggs to cellularize) for 2-3 hours after being taken off before the primary cell culture process began
  - The second cc plate was put on regularly
- On 05/23 1 primary cc flask was make for IMD null flies, and 1 for innubila
- On 05/10 3 primary cc flasks were make for IMD null flies, and 2 for innubila
- These were done with the [updated cell culture protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2022/05/26/2nd-updated-cell-culture-protocol.html)
