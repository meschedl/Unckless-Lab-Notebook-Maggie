title: Electroporating pSPIN-BAC Bacteria with DiNV
---

## Using the Hirt Extracted and Exonuclease Cleaned up DiNV DNA to Electroporate into pSPIN-BAC E. coli 

This is the main experiment for cloning DiNV, hopefully once the DiNV DNA is in the cells that already have the pSPIN-BAC the bacteria will insert the BAC into the DiNV genome and then be able to replicate the genome and keep it because of the chloramphenicol resistance. 

I used DNA from sample 20 (prepared [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/01/25/exo-on-hirt-dna.html)) and the electrocompetent pSPIN-BAC bacteria prepared [here](https://meschedl.github.io/Unckless-Lab-Notebook-Maggie/2024/01/26/electro-comp-cells.html).

I plan to use 2.5ul of DNA because that would be around 70ng of DNA and not too large of a volume to add to the cell mixture for electroporation. The goal is to have less than 3ul added to the cells I think. I want to do a negative sample that gets no DNA but gets the electroporation. And I want a second negative that gets the DNA but does not get electroporated. 

- Prepared 3 1.5mL tubes with 950ul of SOC medium 
- Thawed 3 tubes of electrocompetent cells on ice 
- Placed sample 20 on ice after flick mixing and spinning down 
- Things brought up to Chandler lab:
    - Ice bucket with bacteria and DNA
    - Pipettes and tips
    - 95% ethanol
    - Electroporation cuvettes EC2
    - 1.5mL tubes 
    - Tubes with SOC
- Placed the SOC tubes in their 37C incubator to warm up 
- Placed 2 electroporation cuvettes on ice to chill 
- Neg control 1:
    - Added 50ul of electrocompetent cells in a cold cuvette avoiding bubbles 
    - Electroporated cuvette on EC2 settings
    - Immediately added ~950ul of warm SOC buffer and pipette mixed 
    - Transferred the ~100ul to a 1.5mL labeled "Neg 1" and placed in their 37C shaking incubator for 1 hour 
- Neg control 2:
    - Added 50ul of electrocompetent cells to a 1.5mL tube labeled "Neg 2"
    - Added 2.5ul of sample #20 DNA to the tube 
    - Immediately added ~950ul of warm SOC buffer and pipette mixed
    - Placed in 37C shaking incubator for 1 hour 
- DiNV:
    - Added 50ul of electrocompetent cells to a 1.5mL tube on ice
    - Added 2.5ul of sample #20 DNA to the tube 
    - Flicked to mix the tube and spun down 
    - Transferred the sample mix to a chilled cuvette 
    - Electroporate on EC2 settings 
    - Immediately added ~950ul of warm SOC buffer and pipette mixed 
    - Transferred the ~100ul to a 1.5mL labeled "DiNV" and placed in their 37C shaking incubator for 1 hour 
- During the incubation, prepared the plates:
    - 13 total plates going to be used 
    - 50,000ug.mL * X = 20ug/mL * 25mL 
    - X = 0.01mL or 10ul per plate of stock chloramphenicol needed 
    - I want to have 20ul to add to spread on the plates 
    - Diluted 140ul of stock chlor with 140ul of 100% ethanol 
    - Added 20ul to each of 13 plates and spread them with a sterile spreader made from a pasture pipette 
    - Placed plate in the 37C incubator to warm 
- Prepared 1 1.5mL tube with 1mL of LB and warmed in the 37C incubator 
- After 1 hour, took the tubes down to 4012 
- Centrifuged tubes for 3 min at 3,000rpm 
- Removed the supernatant to a 15mL conical and disposed of in the bacteria waste 
- Resuspended each pellet in 200ul of warm LB medium 
- Spread on the chloramphenicol resistance plates with a sterile loop spreader: 

|plate|volume|sample|
|1|10ul|neg 1|
|2|40ul|neg 1|
|3|150ul|neg 1|
|4|10ul|neg 2|
|5|40ul|neg 2|
|6|150ul|neg 2|
|7|30ul|DiNV|
|8|30ul|DiNV|
|9|30ul|DiNV|
|10|30ul|DiNV|
|11|30ul|DiNV|
|12|20ul|DiNV|
|13|30ul|DiNV|

- Placed the plates upside down in the 37C incubator overnight to grow
